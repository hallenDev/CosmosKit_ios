  "plain_text": "The image of Sadia Sukhraj – lifeless and bloodied on a hospital gurney – will forever be seared into the mind of her grandfather, Prem.\nThe nine-year-old had been with her father, Shailendra, on a school run on Monday when he was pulled from the car while in the driveway of a Shallcross home in Durban by three men, who then sped off with Sadia.\n“The hijackers drove away with the nine-year-old child. The hijacked vehicle was pursued by the child’s father‚ and then there was a shooting‚ so we don’t know exactly how the child got shot and by whom‚” Chatsworth community policing forum chairperson Jakes Singh said.\nGrandfather Prem, a 65-year-old pastor, recounting the family tragedy, said he received a chilling call from his son, also a pastor.\n“He just said: ‘Dad, we have been hijacked and they took my baby away’,” he said.\nHe would only realise later that his granddaughter had died from a single gunshot wound in a nearby hospital, her final moments likely a flurry of panic and pain. \n“I saw her there and that is an image that will never leave me … I don’t think it will,” Prem Sukhraj said, tears welling in his eyes.The hijackers hit a truck and lost control of the vehicle in a nearby park. One of the men was arrested by an off-duty police officer as he fled the scene; another died near the vehicle and a third man remains at large.The injured girl, found lying in the car, is understood to have been rushed to the hospital where she later died.\nAs relatives streamed into the hospital‚ hysterical cries of anguish reverberated through the accident and emergency unit.\nA distraught man collapsed into the arms of another as he sobbed, moments after Sadia had been declared dead.\n“I had lost my son 16 years ago and when she was born she took his place in a way. She really was the star in all of our lives,” her grandfather added. \n“She was a bubbly child and she was a backup singer in church. She was so cheerful and everyone loved her and she really loved the Lord.”Sukhraj said the hijackers were responsible for ending his granddaughter’s life.\n“These guys have taken a child’s life away and that is what is most sad. We are law-abiding citizens and we are good people and they have done this to us. It’s not fair,’ he said.Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said the investigation into the hijacking and shooting remained at a sensitive stage.\nShe could not reveal who had shot at the car, saying it was still being probed. She would not comment on reports that an off-duty policeman fired shots at the hijacked car.\nShe said a wide-scale search for the suspect who remains at large had begun in earnest, and that dockets of murder and hijacking had been registered from investigation.\nMeanwhile, Petros Ngubane, the driver of the truck into which the hijackers crashed, said he had been looking for an address when a speeding car collided into his truck.\n“It was a silver-grey car and then it hit my truck on the side. I then alighted to see the damage caused on the truck. While I was standing there,  the car sped off and came around again [as the road was a cul de sac] and it parked behind the truck.\n“When I went them to ask if they saw the damage they caused on the truck, they tried to run me over and hit me on the leg.”Ngubane said they tried to drive off but the driver realised they couldn’t as a crowd was approaching and he fled. He said he didn’t realise that the girl was in the car at the time.\nShallcross community police forum chairperson Mahendra Lillkan said the incident was the first hijacking in the area in recent months.\n“The community is shocked and saddened by this incident. We just don’t know what to say. General housebreakings have been continuing but hijackings seemed to be under control. We are surprised by what happened this morning‚” he said.",

  "plain_text": "“A serious blow to the fight against organised crime”.\nThat’s how the National Prosecuting Authority has reacted to the Guptas’ successful court bid to unfreeze R250-million of their assets – which the state tried to argue may be the benefits of the alleged Estina Dairy Project scam.\nThe Bloemfontein High Court was not convinced, finding that there no reasonable grounds to believe that the family, their associates or their businesses may be convicted on charges relating to that alleged scam.\nThe Guptas' lawyer, Rudi Krause, says the judgment vindicates the family’s stance “that there is no evidence against them”. He added: “We have made it clear to the National Prosecuting Authority that they should withdraw the case against our clients. If they pursue this case now, they do so at their own threshold.”\nKrause said Monday’s ruling by Judge Phillip Loubser made it clear the NPA “couldn’t pass the lowest threshold required” in their second bid to freeze the Gupta assets.\n“The state was unable to convince a court that our clients may be convicted. Not will, but may. There’s no evidence against these people.”\nThis is a second, devastating blow for the state in its Estina prosecution. Earlier this year, its first successful attempt to freeze R220-million in assets linked to the alleged Estina Dairy Project scam as the proceeds of crime, or the instrumentality of an offence, was reversed by High Court Judge Fouche Jordaan.Following that ruling, the state successfully froze R250-million in Gupta assets, on the basis that they could be confiscated following the conviction of Gupta family members and associates in the ongoing Estina criminal prosecution.\nJudge Loubser has now reversed this second order – which he made – and suggested he would not have made it in the first place if he'd had access to the Jordaan ruling and an affidavit by the Bank of Baroda. \nIn that affidavit, the bank argued that the AFU had mistakenly used its Nedbank pool account – which served 750 clients – to argue that Estina had made payments directly to Atul Gupta, and other Gupta entities.\nReacting to Loubser’s ruling, the NPA’s Luvuyo Mfaku said the state was “very surprised” by the decision.\n“We never expected this kind of ruling. It is a serious blow to the fight against organised crime, because Asset Forfeiture processes exist to ensure that those implicated in such organised crime do not benefit financially.\n“We will study the judgment before we consider our legal options in response to it. But this is a serious setback.”",

  "plain_text": "When Siya Kolisi becomes the first black Springbok Test captain against England next month he will end more than a century of white players captaining the national team. \nThe Boks play against Wales in Washington on June 2 and provincial teammate Pieter-Steph du Toit has been asked to lead the team that day. Kolisi and 16 other players from the 43-man squad chosen for June’s Tests will stay behind to prepare for England.\nAt Ellis Park on June 9 when Kolisi leads the team he will be playing in his 29th Test and will become Bok captain No 61. Du Toit is Bok captain No 60.Kolisi though is not the first black player to captain the Springboks – hooker Chiliboy Ralepelle led the Boks against a World XV in a non-Test in 2006.\nBut for both young men it is a massive moment in their professional and personal lives and they will forever be known as Springbok captains. There are only 59 other men, in 127 years since SA played its first of 477 Tests in 1891, who could say that.\nBut for Kolisi and South Africa his appointment is a much broader statement that rugby’s glacial progression to a truly multiracial sport in SA is gathering pace. The white-tipped polar icecaps of Bok rugby have melted.\nKolisi is only 26 but he has played 103 Super Rugby games and has been part of the Springbok squad since 2012. He has earned his spurs as a player and more recently as a leader.\n“The Stormers captaincy has helped my rugby in a massive way. I’m not someone who gives Braveheart speeches. I’m all about my deeds,” Kolisi said in a recent interview.\n“I’ve come to realise that you won’t play well in every game. It’s something I’ve had to learn to cope with because as a leader I put myself under huge pressure to perform every week. I’m learning to deal with that personal pressure and the captaincy.”Stormers coach Robbie Fleck took a chance on appointing Kolisi as captain last year. It seemed like a risky move at the time but one Fleck had no qualms about then and still doesn’t now.\n“When I told Siya that I was considering him as Stormers captain he was at a bit of a crossroads in his career,” Fleck recalls. “He was drifting a little. So we chatted about where he could go if he took the right path and also that he had a lot more value to add to SA rugby both on and off the field.\n“Maybe he just needed someone to say: ‘Take your rugby more seriously’ and to also point out given his background that he had a far greater calling in SA.\n“When I heard his speech at his wedding, I was blown away. It was the most uplifting speech, delivered without notes, coming straight from the heart. He spoke about his upbringing, where he wanted to go and what he wanted to achieve.\n“It was full of the great values you want in a leader, and the room was captivated. That convinced me that his leadership potential was huge.”It took a few conversations, including at Kolisi’s wedding to Rachel, for the tough flank to start believing in the potential of his natural leadership that Fleck saw.\n“In 2016 Fleckie (coach Robbie Fleck) said I needed to realise that I was now a senior player in the side. He was blunt. I had to get my act together,” Kolisi said.\n“It made me switch my mentality. I realised that I had to stop hiding and acting like a child in the team. I had to man up and show leadership because even though I was 24 I was already quite experienced.”\nKolisi has grown as a leader and he will do some more growing over the next month but Fleck knows better than most that he will step up as a Springbok captain as well.“Siya is a hard working professional and an extremely well-respected player in the squad,” Fleck says. “He has earned those stripes by putting in the work. He is extremely humble and the Springboks would like to see him bringing out the best in the players and bringing great values to the team environment.\n“Siya will develop a tight-knit culture, which is something he has achieved at the Stormers. Through good times and mostly tough times this season, he has kept the players together. That was obvious last weekend when we were down to 14 and even 13 men [against the Lions]. The guys kept playing for each other and the jersey, which is largely down to Siya’s leadership.\n“He is a popular guy across all cultures and different types of dynamics within a team and that’s something I’m sure Rassie and Boks were looking for in their captain.\n“Tactically and technically his on-field leadership has grown and is still growing. Rassie will have a huge influence in improving that side of his game as well.\n“But tactics and relations with referees are something that can be taught and learned, but what Siya has, that can’t be taught, is an innate ability to connect people and pull them together as a group. That comes naturally to him. He has the ability to pull people together and fight for a common cause with ease.”",

  "plain_text": "The army's violent eviction of hundreds of civilians from a Gauteng defence force base, during which homeowners were threatened and assaulted with military weapons, has been raised with an African Union commission.\nNow video footage, which the SA National Defence Force successfully excluded from a recent court case on the evictions, has emerged showing how soldiers in armoured vehicles threatened the residents, including the elderly, women and children.\nThe videos were taken on cellphones by residents.\nThe army denied in court papers that they were behind the forceful evictions.\nThe alleged assaults resulted in five people being admitted to hospital in Nigel on the East Rand, where the base is located, with soldiers detaining community leaders during the three-day operation before releasing them without being charged.\nWater supplies to the houses were cut to stop residents returning.\nEarlier this month, international lawyers and leaders of the community living on the Marievale army base met with a special rapporteur from the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights in Mauritania.\nA report on the eviction by civil rights non-governmental organisation International Commission of Jurists [ICJ] is now to be submitted to the commission.It is hoped that the report will be used in an international investigation and see the government answer on why the evictions, carried out as part of the SANDF’s Operation Prosper, were allowed and ensure those responsible are held accountable.\nThe evicted people allege that coal- and brick-mining companies Brikor and Ilangabi Coal, which have quarries near the base, are behind the evictions, and claim the evictions are linked to a recent mining application by the companies.But, the companies' chief executive, Garnet Parkin, disputes the claims and says they have no interest in expanding their operations towards the base.\n“Our application, which was made in 2016, was for an area away from the base.  We have only ever tried to help the community, and hold regular meetings with residents.”Three weeks ago the Pretoria High Court ruled that the evictions, which took place in November 2017, were illegal and ordered that those who were evicted be allowed to return to their homes.\nThe defence force, which fought Lawyers for Human Rights' challenge to have the evictions declared illegal, said the accommodation was needed for soldiers.\nWhen Times Select visited the base last week, many of the houses were in a state of disrepair, with some missing roofs and doors and windows broken.\nThe former residents now live 200m away in shacks, with no running water or sanitation.  \nTimes Select understands that while Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula has said she will abide by the ruling, the state attorney, allegedly at the behest of those on South Africa's military command council, will appeal the ruling on Tuesday.In his affidavit, South African army chief Lieutenant-General Lindile Yam said the military had been conducting a training exercise in November on the base with newcomers to the military police, when it was discovered that 86 of the 124 state houses – which were for military personnel and their families – were being sub-let to civilians.\nHe said that during the operation it was discovered that brothels, shebeens, drug dens and spaza shops were being run from the accommodation, which had been turned into a “crime haven”.“It is denied that the Respondents forcefully ‘evicted’ the alleged civilians of Marievale ... Members of [the] Defence [force] are self-disciplined and under no circumstances can they take the law into their own hands or be giving instructions or orders to intimidate, threaten, harass, assault, attack or forcefully evict civilians without a due process of the law.\n“The reasons the sub-leasees had left the military base are unknown to the Respondents ... All the applicants are not members of the SANDF and there was no wrongful deprivation of their alleged homes.”\nHe said the military did not know what reasons the soldiers, who were sub-letting their properties, had given to the tenants, which caused them to leave the houses.\nYam said those officers who had illegally been renting out the houses were being disciplined.\n“The Department of Defence's policy is to protect the interests of the state property and to maintain an acceptable standard of the military discipline.”SANDF spokesperson Brigadier General Mafi Mgobozi said the matter had been before the courts and they were unable to comment further.\nMapisa-Nqakula failed to respond to questions.\nThe eviction, which is the third attempt to remove residents from the base since 2009, has raised questions over whether President Cyril Ramaphosa, who as commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces must authorise military deployments both abroad and internally, gave permission for the operation, or whether he was informed of it as he should have been.  \nResidents say they have had rental agreements with the Public Works Department and SANDF for more than 20 years.\nCommunity leader Chris Koitsioe, who raised the evictions with the commission’s special rapporteur, said they had learnt that high-profile anti-apartheid stalwarts, with links to the military, were linked to the mining companies, which they believed were behind the evictions.“What happened is a gross human rights violation. Workers from the mine have been threatened with the loss of their jobs if they support court actions against the evictions.\n“We have been hounded and beaten out of our homes and are still barred from our houses.”\nWillem Koekemoer, who has years of rental agreement receipts, alleged he was beaten with guns when soldiers dragged him from his home.\n“I tried to go to my elderly parents' house to help them, but the soldiers came at me. They held a gun to my back and threatened to shoot.\n“They threatened my children with their guns. They were thugs.”\nTimothy Fish Hodgson, an ICJ legal adviser, said they helped the Marievale community and other South African activist organisations approach the commission to raise awareness about human rights abuses and to put pressure on the government to assist in ending it.\nHe said they first met at an NGO forum, ahead of the commission's sitting, to raise issues relating to human rights abuses . \n“The forum makes resolutions which are then presented to the commission.”He said the Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders specifically requested a report detailing the abuse Marievale residents and other activists had suffered. \n“This is significant as the Special Rapporteur can approach the South African government and request responses to the allegations. The rapporteur can enter the country to conduct an independent investigation into the alleged abuses.\n“The government and military need to explain how they have not violated the constitution.”\nLouise du Plessis of Lawyers for Human rights said that during the court case on the evictions the military had repeatedly “flat-out” denied that they had evicted the residents.\n“Their denial was also contained in their affidavits. Throughout the proceedings they insisted that the families had moved out themselves on their own accord, and that they had no idea why they would have moved.\n“The videos and photographs provide proof and show without doubt that the military forcibly evicted the residents.”Du Plessis said the eviction took place despite the Johannesburg High Court interdicting the defence force from evicting the residents in November last year.\nPikkie Greeff, SA National Defence Union general secretary, said the the military, like everyone else, had to abide by the constitution.\n“The president has to approve all deployments, which this was. What happened has set a dangerous precedent where someone in the military thinks they can use soldiers to by-pass the law.”\nConstitutional law expert Geo Quinot said the military’s primary constitutional objective was “to defend and protect the republic, its territorial integrity and its people”.\n“While the military can argue this was an internal matter, the use of military equipment raises serious questions as to why such hardware was needed to resolve internal issues, and could potentially border on unconstitutional actions.”",

  "plain_text": "Buying property next door to an industrial abattoir waste dump is not what Pierre Gerber had in mind when he invested in the foothills of the Langeberge.\nGerber is one of several landowners in the rural outskirts of Robertson appealing this month’s decision by the Western Cape government to approve a land use application for an abattoir waste facility in their rural neighbourhood.  Three other approvals are still needed, but jittery landowners fear the project could spell disaster for the local tourist industry.The organic dump project is driven by a local businessman and farmer Hennie de Bod who uses waste from his Robertson abattoir to make organic compost on his property in nearby Nuy. De Bod wants to significantly expand his current operation, which is capped at 10 tons of abattoir waste – including blood, intestines and other forms of offal.But Gerber and other objectors believe the facility, if approved, would act as a magnet for organic waste throughout the region, thereby turning a pristine area into a busy waste disposal hub.\n“There are a lot of chicken farms and other abattoirs, and they will also come and dump here if (De Bod’s) fees are less,” said Gerber. “You won’t be able to close the gate once you’ve opened it – it is a no-go,” he said.\nHanneré Jooste, who owns the private nature reserve adjoining De Bod’s property, this week confirmed she had appealed province’s rezoning decision. In her initial objection to the project Jooste claimed she was affected by bad odours and a marked increase in flies since dumping began. She has also objected to a proposed dam project on De Bod’s farm which also awaits approval.However, the project appears to enjoy the in-principle support of the Western Cape Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning (DEADP) which has adopted a policy of diverting organic waste from landfill sites to farms where it can be treated or “beneficiated”. \n“Composting of organic waste takes place on numerous farms throughout the province,” said Rudolf van Jaarsveldt, DEADP communications chief.\n“Should this facility be approved it can reduce the impact of organic waste on the environment. Organic waste will not be disposed at a landfill where the methane will be released in the open air, but be beneficiated/treated at the composting facility,” Van Jaarsveldt said. “This is definitely not a waste dump. In fact it is a strategic facility for the region because the organic waste of the Municipality will also be treated here as the Municipality does not have a facility available to treat this waste type.”\nGerber said it was clear the plan was to use De Bod’s farm as a regional dump for all manner of waste, from a variety of sources: “There are other abattoirs and chicken farms around here. Once (De Bod) has permisison, can you imagine what will happen?  All that shit will go there,” Gerber said.He said there was a similar situation in the Drakenstein municipality which was looking at building a massive incinerator to dispose of waste imported from other towns. \n“At the end of the day this (facility) is bad for the area,” Gerber said. “They (government) can expropriate land if they don’t have enough for the municipal dump, or get something closer to the tar road.”\nLangeberg Municipality municipal manager Soyisile Mokweni confirmed De Bod’s project still needed municipal land use planning approval, environmental approval by DEADP, and Department of Water Affairs and Sanitation approval for the dam project, Mokweni said.\nDe Bod insists his expanded business is a huge investment opportunity for the region. One local farmer said the organic waste produced on site was of superior quality. However during a site visit earlier this year other affected stakeholders questioned whether Nuy was the appropriate venue for a major waste facility.",

  "plain_text": "Over 10 people, including a high school friend who she had not seen in decades, had come forward to save her life but, in the end, a Johannesburg mother found her match in an incompatible family friend.\nMother of three and artist Di Wilkinson is the first South African living without both kidneys to undergo desensitisation and receive a kidney transplant.\nDesensitisation is a process that removes antibodies that would have otherwise rejected a donated organ. While it’s considered a routine procedure before transplants in the United States, it is done on a small scale in South Africa.Wilkinson, 57, had been on the transplant list for five years with no success. Wilkinson’s plight reached far and wide with even an appeal from a stranger to US comedian and TV host Ellen DeGeneres to help find her a kidney.   \nFinally a family friend, who does not wish to be identified, came forward.\nHer daughter Legh said it was heartbreaking to discover that while her mother and the living donor’s blood type was a match, Wilkinson’s antibodies were so high that she was not a compatible match with him.The family then got wind of desensitisation, which would reduce her antibodies and force a match with her live donor. \n“We made contact with the South African professor who had conducted desensitisations and then transplants in South Africa to further investigate this novel treatment.\n“Although he had never conducted this treatment on a patient with as high antibodies as our mom as well as a patient who had undergone a double nephrectomy – removal of both kidneys – he agreed we could give it a try,” Legh said.\nWilkinson was taken into the Wits University Donald Gordon Medical Centre theatre for the transplant on the morning of May 10.\n“It was the longest wait of our lives and for the live donor’s wife. Excruciating may be the word. A few hours later the live donor was wheeled through to ICU, groggy but safe and he was followed by my mom three or so hours later. The transplant had been done,” Legh said.\nShe said her mother was doing well.\n“She is still in pain and it is very early days. She will have a biopsy to check all is well with her new kidney.”The head of nephrology at the University of Witwatersrand and of the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg hospital's renal unit, Professor Graham Paget, conducted the desensitisation and transplant.\nPaget explained that antibodies, which form against a potential donor’s kidney antigens, are formed through sensitising events like pregnancy and blood transfusions.\nOnce the procedure is conducted, a recipient’s body would no longer recognise certain antigens in the donor as being foreign, thereby accepting the organ.\n“Desensitisation is not usually necessary before most transplants; it is more expensive with a higher risk of infections post-transplant. It is only necessary when a dialysis patient cannot find any donor for a transplant because his or her immune system has ‘seen’ many antigens and therefore will reject kidneys from almost anybody that you try to use as a donor,” he said.\nHe added that the procedure was becoming more necessary as more patients wait for years on dialysis and maybe get transfused as they experience problems.\n“The key to avoiding the need to desensitise is to encourage more people to consider donating their kidney while alive or registering as organ donors in the event of death,” he said.\nWilkinson survived without both kidneys through “good dialysis and excellent compliance with diet and restriction of fluids”.\n“Patients on dialysis with no urine output have a tough time. Imagine only being allowed to drink a maximum of one litre of all fluids per 24 hours every day of the year!”",

  "plain_text": "Playing  video games that demand movement, a type of physical activity dubbed “exergaming”, improve the quality of life of heart failure patients, new research shows.\nHead of the study Professor Tiny Jaarsma, from Linköping University in Sweden, said: “Exergaming is an alternative way for patients with heart failure to be physically active. It increases their fitness and can improve their wellbeing because they can do more in their day-to-day life.”\nStanding in front of a TV set playing virtual tennis benefited wellbeing as well as increasing the potential to walk further, the scientists found.\nSylvia Shapshak, the mother of Stuff editor-in-chief Toby Shapshak, still wants to play virtual tennis at 90 years old.\nWhen Wii Sports first came out, Shapshak gave his parents virtual games to test, including tennis, and they had such fun that they didn’t want to give the games back to him.\nHalf of the 600 participants in the latest HF-Wii study followed standard exercise routines and half were assigned to do exergaming.\nThey had the game set up for them at home, and a tutorial on how to play, and were advised to play for half an hour a day – the same duration as the other patients were advised.A six-minute walk test was used to test their exercise capacity after three months. The patients in the “exergame” group could walk 33m further on average than those in the other group, the researchers reported in 2017.\nThe new findings on how active video games impact on the wellbeing, anxiety and depression of the participants were presented this week at Heart Failure 2018 and the World Congress on Acute Heart Failure in Europe.\n“The exergame group had greater improvement than the standard exercise group in all three variables, but only quality of life reached statistical significance,” the results showed.\nJaarsma said: “We think quality of life improved with exergaming because patients could walk further and do more activities around the house with those metres gained.\n“Patients also told us they felt more included socially. They often played the game with friends, their spouse, or grandchildren. ‘They visit to beat grandmother’, said one patient.”For heart failure patients this is rejuvenating as they often feel their lives are restricted by a list of things they cannot do.\nJaarsma said: “This new way of exercising is something patients can do. Exergaming enables them to be active at home. For example, patients like being able to play tennis for half an hour with their spouse without having to go out.”\nResearchers from the Pennysylvania School of Medicine recently found that gaming strategies, using activity trackers, and involving friends in exercise, were effective in boosting people’s physical activity.\nFamilies who used fitness trackers with gaming elements reached daily fitness goals nearly 30% more than those who did not.\nSouth Africa has major wellness programmes that successfully use incentives, like gaming does, to encourage people to exercise.",

As the newly crowned Miss SA, there was no wild rock-star party in her suite; instead, coffee and tea were the drink of choice as she spent much-needed time with her family before making a brief appearance at the after-party.\nStill reeling with excitement and adrenaline, she admits she had a “gut feeling” that she’d win, and was prepared.\n“I wrote a note to myself in case I won. The note said: ‘Remember who you are, remember the people who’ve supported you and remember you love medicine’,” Green said.\nThis year’s pageant featured not one but two winners. Green, who was crowned Miss SA 2018, is also the Miss Universe South Africa, while 26-year-old Thulisa Keyi was crowned Miss World South Africa. Both will represent the country in the respective international competitions later this year.An emotional Green said that she was “quite anxious” about her new role.  To keep herself grounded, she has vowed to carry a memento from family and friends wherever she goes.\n“My family and friends gave me a book with messages and pictures in it. I read through it just before I went on stage. I’m going to carry that around with me just to remember who the people were that helped me get to where I am, where I am from, and to remain grounded,” she said.\nHer prize includes a R1-million cash injection from Cell C and Sun International as well as a fully furnished and serviced upmarket Johannesburg flat for the year of reign, a Nissan Qashqai worth R445,500 and the use of designer garments for her red-carpet looks.\nShe wants to focus on child health during her reign. \n“I don’t have a clear idea of what my campaign is going to be, but I really want to focus on child health because that’s what I’m passionate about. What I’ve realised, studying medicine, is that child trauma is very prevalent in South Africa. I want to bring women empowerment into that and educate parents on simple things like how to prevent child injuries within the household,” Green said.\nBut before the business started, she had to focus on media interviews and bidding farewell to Cape Town and her family. Describing the move to Johannesburg as “overwhelming”, Green said she was optimistic she would grow to love her new city and enjoy the opportunity to explore other parts of South Africa.Her sister Lauren took to Instagram to congratulate her beauty-queen sister.\n“What a fantastic evening we had last night.

  "plain_text": "There is, I learned this week, something drifting through the corporate world, like an odour released from an open drain, that calls itself a “conversation architect”.\nThis person, I discovered, is someone who designs the conversations that businesses need to have in order to remain healthy.\nI’ve had contact with a few businesses and I can confirm that there are plenty of conversations they need to have. I’m just not sure they need a conversation architect more than, say, a kindergarten teacher, who will sit everyone on beanbags before gently ushering in such topics as “Emotions are things human beings have” and “Why it is bad to actively hurt people”.\nOf course, “conversation architect” is just the latest bullshit title in an almost endless list that started when a flint-chipper decided to rebrand himself as a “geological technologist”.\nSome have been around for a while but have been given new prominence by the Internet. “Wordsmith”, for example, is a thing I strive not to be, mostly because “wordsmith” is a word loved by people who actively hate language and the written word. If anyone ever describes you as a “wordsmith” you can either sue for defamation or accept that you are producing horrible work and go and do that plumbing course your mom always wanted you to do.Still, I’d rather be a wordsmith than a “product philosopher”, a person hired by tech giants to whisper sweet, humane nothings so that it looks like said tech giants aren’t in fact building killer robots that will use our own Facebook updates to learn our weaknesses and exterminate us.\nAs for “fashion evangelist” – someone who urges you to wear certain clothes and accessories so that you will find love and fulfilment at some future date – well, that’s just a normal evangelist, isn’t it?\nYes, job titles can be squawking, flashing bullshit detectors. And in South African politics, we’ve had some special ones.\nConsider the Commander-In-Chief. No, not Cyril Ramaphosa, the actual Commander-In-Chief. I mean the make-belief, dress-up one that some media still sometimes unblushingly refer to as Commander-In-Chief: the leader of the third-largest political party in the land, Julius Malema.\nTaken literally, it’s a flagrant lie that borders on sedition: if you call yourself Commander-In-Chief you are claiming to be president of the country. But of course Malema isn’t lying or stoking sedition because, as we all know from TV and magazines, it’s not a lie if it’s an advertisement. And if you’re going to sell a brand, the first thing you have to do is distinguish yourself from other brands.\nIn this case, if you’re going to show that you’re not the ANC, you need to reject everything that the ANC is, including being a political party staffed by civilians. The fight for pow – sorry, I mean economic freedom – can no longer be political. Politics, after all, has failed. The old ways have failed. The media fails every day, peddling lies. That’s why the party faithful will reject all of it and put on red hats that read “Make America Great Again” and – wait, that’s not right, is it?\nSome people have been alarmed by the EFF’s militaristic jargon, but, to be fair, its only alternative was honesty and it wouldn’t be nearly as sexy if it had named itself what it is: A Normal Political Party For the Advancement of Some Generally Socialist Ideas Which Will Make Some Huge Concessions to Traditional Capitalism Should It Ever Get Into Power And Be Faced With the Ideology-Crushing Demands Of Existing In A Capitalist World.The ANC, too, has given us some spectacularly dodgy job descriptions: who knew, until Jacob Zuma, that “president” was a synonym for “co-conspirator”? Its most duplicitous, however, has been the ubiquitous “comrade”, a colonial title imported from the then Soviet Empire that is surely our great oxymoron: a name pretending solidarity and common cause while denying a history drenched in blood and a recent past in which rich rogues tried to cut each other’s throats for the opportunity to steal a little bit more from the poor.\nStill, not even the EFF on its most pompous day or the ANC on its most larcenous could make me burst out laughing as I did when I discovered that the DA top brass refer to Mmusi Maimane as “the Leader”. In public. On purpose.\nIt’s part primary school clique having a secret meeting to swap stickers behind the toilets, part North Korean labour farm, part religious jungle death cult. And it’s altogether hilarious. Still, perhaps that’s what happens when politicians’ fights become public and the smooth façade starts cracking: you start believing that if you say “Leader” enough, one might just appear.\nBut that’s enough from me. Next thing you call me a wordsmith and then we can’t be friends any more.",

Nasa claimed that Bean’s crew accomplished “150%” of their pre-launch targets.\nBean next served as back-up commander of Apollo-Soyuz in 1975, the first Soviet-American docking in space, before resigning from Nasa in June 1981.

  "plain_text": "Alan Bean, who has died at the age of 86, was the fourth of the 12 Americans to walk on the moon; four years later he commanded the three-man crew who spent 59 days aboard Nasa’s Skylab space station, which preceded the International Space Station.\nHe spent his post-astronaut life as a professional painter, recording his experiences and describing himself as “the first artist to walk on another world”.\nBean was the lunar module pilot on Apollo 12, the second Nasa mission to the moon in November 1969, only four months after the historic first landing by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on Apollo 11.\nThe launch of Apollo 12 was the only one witnessed in person by a US president. Richard Nixon attended with his wife and daughter – which was probably why the launch went ahead during a thunderstorm. Lightning struck the Saturn V rocket and its spacecraft twice, but while debating whether to abort the launch, the crew recovered control.Bean’s role in salvaging the mission was crucial. When Mission Control radioed up an obscure command to reset the stricken electrical system (“Try SCE to Aux”) his friend and commander, Pete Conrad, was at a loss for what to do, staring at a bewildering array of flashing emergency lights. Bean, trawling the memories of his meticulous training, leaned forward and calmly flicked the correct switch.Apollo 12’s most remarkable achievement was that, after a 386,000km journey from Earth, the spacecraft landed only 180m from its target, the unmanned Surveyor 3 spacecraft that had been soft-landed in the moon’s Ocean of Storms on a reconnaissance mission 31 months earlier.\nBean, photographed by Conrad, walked across to it and recovered the television camera and other components so that the long-term effects of exposure in harsh lunar conditions could be studied on Earth.\nWhile the crew of Apollo 11 had spent less than three hours on the lunar surface, Bean and Conrad spent nearly eight hours exploring the Ocean of Storms. They deployed a package of six scientific instruments with a nuclear-powered battery which, with other instruments deployed on four subsequent missions, made it possible to send back details of moonquakes and other events for a further five years until they were finally abandoned by Nasa for reasons of economy.Nevertheless, there were some setbacks. Premium advertising had been booked on US television networks for insertion during the first colour transmissions from the lunar surface. But these were abruptly ended when Bean, asked to move the TV camera to a better position during one of the astronauts’ two excursions on the surface, accidentally pointed it at the sun.\nAs a member of the MacBean Clan of Inverness-shire, Bean was proud of his Scottish ancestry and carried a swatch of MacBean tartan to the lunar surface inside his landing craft, Intrepid. He would depict the euphoric moment of his first steps on the lunar surface in his 1996 painting Clan MacBean Arrives on the Moon.Bean also made a point of indulging his love of Italian food while in space, humorously insisting that he was the first person to eat spaghetti on the moon.\nWith the third crew member, Captain Richard Gordon, whose job was to remain in lunar orbit in the command module to bring them home again, the Apollo 12 team formed such a united and articulate trio that many thought that Nasa would have been better served if they had made the first landing.\nDestined for space\nAlan LaVern Bean was born at Wheeler, in the Texas panhandle, on March 15 1932. He was brought up in Louisiana, where his father was a US government scientist, and attended the RL Paschal High School in Fort Worth. After graduating in aeronautical engineering from the University of Texas in 1955, he joined the US Navy as a student.\nDuring training as a test pilot one of his instructors was Charles “Pete” Conrad; both were selected respectively for the second and third group of astronauts.\nWhile Conrad progressed rapidly in the highly competitive selection process for space missions, the artistically inclined Bean seemed destined to be nothing more than a back-up astronaut. But when a member of Conrad’s moon-landing crew was killed in a fighter-jet crash, Conrad insisted that Bean, his former pupil, should be the replacement for Apollo 12.In 1972 Bean was given command of the second manned mission to the Skylab space station, created from the vast interior of a Saturn rocket’s 90-ton upper stage. Skylab suffered severe damage during the launch, but Conrad, who commanded the whole project, restored it to serviceability with some heroic spacewalks that involved physically pulling out the one remaining solar wing.\nAfter Conrad’s return to Earth, Bean’s crew spent a record 59 days on board, attending to further repairs and using Skylab’s telescope to study solar flares. He was accompanied by two spiders, Anita and Arabella, which attracted much media attention by successfully spinning a somewhat misshapen web in the weightless conditions.Although Bean and his crew fed the arthropods with dead flies, they died before returning to Earth. Nasa claimed that Bean’s crew accomplished “150%” of their pre-launch targets.\nBean next served as back-up commander of Apollo-Soyuz in 1975, the first Soviet-American docking in space, before resigning from Nasa in June 1981. He announced that, having seen sights that no artist had witnessed before, he would devote himself to trying to express them in his paintings.\nFor the next 35 years he produced an average of five or six acrylic paintings a year, in which he sought to express astronauts’ reactions to space flight. It was years before he was satisfied with his most important work, a self-portrait in a spacesuit submerged in dust, called That’s How It Felt to Walk On The Moon, trying to decide how much colour the human imagination added to the neutral whites and greys of a Nasa photograph.\nHe sold signed copies of this and other works on the Internet for up to $2,000 a time. Incorporated in the originals of many of his lunar landscapes were specks of moon dust recovered from his Apollo 12 spacesuit.As an international lecturer and exponent of manned space flight, Bean was among the most successful of the post-mission astronauts, commanding full houses when he visited Britain in 2006 and 2013.\nHe was also one of the most approachable of the lunar astronauts, a humble and modest man who, unusually among test pilots, admitted to experiencing fear in space.\nCounting down their final hours and minutes on the lunar surface in the cabin of their small craft, Bean could not help nervously thinking of the single engine at his back that was their only way home. But it fired flawlessly, right on time, and propelled him and Conrad back to their colleague, Gordon, who was waiting in lunar orbit to transport them on the three-day voyage back to Earth.Upon his safe return, Bean relished the simplest of earthly pleasures: sitting on his own in Houston’s huge Galleria mall, eating ice cream and watching the passers-by, marvelling at the mundane miracle of human existence.\n“Don’t look for heaven elsewhere,” he said. “I’ve seen the Earth as a ball in the empty black sky. This is heaven.”\nHe firmly believed that one day a painting of his would hang in a gallery on the moon.\nAlan Bean’s first marriage to Sue Ragsdale, a schoolteacher, was dissolved in 1977. He then married Leslie Clem, a medical executive with whom he settled in Houston, Texas. There he had his art studio and kept their boisterous Lhasa Apso dogs. She survives him with a son and a daughter from his first marriage.\n• Alan Bean, born on March 15 1932, died on May 26 2018.",

  "plain_text": "A Malian migrant hailed a national hero for scaling a building to save a four-year old dangling from a fourth-floor balcony in Paris is to be granted French nationality and given a job as a fireman.\nA video of Mamoudou Gassama's spectacular rescue went viral on social media and has been viewed millions of times.With a crowd below cheering him on from the street, the migrant pulled himself from balcony to balcony at risk of life and limb, and managed to grab the four-year-old as a neighbour unsuccessfully tried to reach the boy from the nearest flat.President Emmanuel Macron invited Gassama to the Elysee Palace on Monday morning to personally thank him. During their filmed conversation, Gassama said he was trembling like a leaf after his courageous act.\nAfterwards, Macron announced that he would be granted French citizenship and join the French fire brigade.Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo also lauded the 22-year-old's heroism, and said she had called him to thank him in person. She hailed him as the “Spiderman of the 18th”, a reference to the Paris district where the rescue took place.“Congratulations to Mamoudou Gassama for his act of bravery that saved the life of a child,” Hidalgo tweeted.“He explained to me that he had arrived from Mali a few months ago dreaming of building his life here.\n“I replied that his heroic gesture was an example for all citizens and that the City of Paris will obviously be keen to support him in his efforts to settle in France.”\nHinting that he could expect a fast track to residency, government spokesperson Benjamin Griveaux tweeted: “This huge act of bravery, faithful to the values of solidarity of our republic, must open the doors to our national community.”A petition has been launched online.\nRights group SOS Racisme said: “Mamoudou Gassama serves as a useful reminder to us that people without papers are human beings with ... great bravery that many have shown in their perilous journey to Europe – bravery that they often continue to display here.”\nLegs like jelly\nThe drama took place on Saturday evening on a street in the north of the French capital. Gassama told journalists he had been in the vicinity when he saw a crowd gathered in front of the building.\n“I saw lots of people shouting and cars beeping. I saw that the child was going to fall from the balcony. I did it because it was a child,” BFM TV quoted him as saying.\n“I climbed ... Thank God I saved him.”\nHe added: “When I got the child, he was crying. I asked him where his mother was. He replied that she was at a party.”\nOnce safely inside, he said his legs felt like jelly and he collapsed on a couch.\nThe Parisian fire service said crews had arrived to find the child had already been rescued. “Luckily, there was someone who was physically fit and who had the courage to go and get the child,” a spokesperson said.\nLocal authorities quoted by French media said the child's parents were not at home at the time. The mother was not in Paris at the time, it is believed.\nThe father has been questioned by police on suspicion of leaving his child unattended, judicial sources say. He faces charges of “dereliction of parental duty”, a crime that carries a maximum two-year prison term.\nThe child has been placed into care for the time being.\nHostage hero\nThis is not the first time an undocumented migrant has been hailed a hero in France.Lassana Bathily, a Malian Muslim, was awarded French citizenship after helping save the lives of several customers during a terrorist hostage drama in a Jewish supermarket in Paris in 2014 in which four people were killed, as well as the assailant.\nThe 24-year-old shop assistant was in the underground stockroom of the Hyper Casher store when gunman Amédy Coulibaly burst in upstairs, firing from a Kalashnikov. He hid many in a freezer, which he switched off.\n– © The Daily Telegraph",

  "plain_text": "Attacks on UK small businesses by vegan activists are on the rise, according to the Countryside Alliance.\nDeath threats, stoked by social media and encouraged by international groups of activists, have caused butchers and farmers to “live in fear”.\nMarlow Butchers, in, Ashford, Kent, was targeted earlier this month by activists who daubed red paint on the doors and windows of the shop.Since then, the business has been subjected to online abuse.\nWayne Marlow, who runs the business with his father and brother, said: “On the Internet it has been very threatening.\n“It has got ridiculous – activists from as far away as Australia are getting involved.\n“The Internet is the worst thing as not only are they threatening to physically destroy our business, but they are also tying to ruin our reputation online, too, by leaving negative reviews and comments.“They want to close us down and people are threatening to smash the windows or petrol-bomb the store.\n“We live in fear and we’re up worrying at night – they are terrorising us.”The family has reported the threats to the police.\nTim Bonner, chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, said: “There’s been an escalation of attacks on butchers, markets and even abattoirs and it’s an extension of animal rights campaigns we have seen around other areas, using the same tactics including online abuse.\n“They usually attack small independent businesses rather than taking on the big boys – it’s quite cowardly.”He said that international groups co-ordinate attacks which take place in the UK, explaining: “Social media has been a catlalyst for much of this campaigning, both in terms of bringing together international groups and if they find the right independent business it does bring a lot of pressure on family businesses and farmers.”\nBonner also said that social media companies do not take the threats seriously enough: “None of the social media platforms view the abuse of those involved in meat production as they would other minorities. This is understandable but there has to be an equality of response when people like this butcher or others are being targeted.“It’s both personally threatening and people feel unsafe. They are not putting themselves forward on a controversial issue; they are just carrying on the business that their family has for generations.\n“There’s a really nasty and cowardly tactic, using things like TripAdvisor and other online platforms to do fake reviews and it can have a direct effect on their livelihood.”Veganism is on the rise – over half of young people have attempted the diet in the last year – but most will throw in the towel after just three-and-a-half months.\nNew research has looked into the nation’s diet habits and revealed as many as 56% of Britons between the ages of 16 and 29 have recently attempted to emulate the plant-based diets of celebrity vegans like Beyoncé, Brad Pitt, Pink and Ellie Goulding.\nHowever, for the majority, the change in lifestyle is short-lived with 28% of adults finding it “too difficult” to stick to.\nThe poll of 2,000 adults, by Kellogg’s, found that 16% of those who tried a plant-based diet said it was impossible when eating out in restaurants.\n– © The Daily Telegraph\n• Vegan group All Animal Rights however had a different view on the incident, calling it redecoration rather than a planned attack.",

  "plain_text": "South Korean boyband phenomenon BTS have become the first K-pop group to rise to the top of the US album charts, a vivid illustration of the genre’s growing global appeal.\nKnown for their boyish good looks, floppy haircuts and meticulously choreographed dance moves, the septet has become one of South Korea’s best known and most lucrative musical exports.On Sunday they passed a new milestone — becoming the first K-pop group to top the Billboard 200 music charts which ranks albums via sales, downloads and streams.\n“It’s the first No1 for the seven-member group, and the first K-pop album to lead the tally,” Billboard wrote in its online report detailing the latest chart ranking.While plenty of older music listeners in the West might be asking “who?”, it is hard to underestimate the popularity of BTS and its seven stars Suga, J-Hope, Rap Monster, Jimin, V, Jungkook and Jin.\nAccording to one data analysis, they were the most talked-about phenomenon on Twitter in 2017, with nearly twice the number of mentions as President Donald Trump and Justin Bieber combined.Add in their similarly massive appeal across the globe — they have huge social media followings in Japan, China, Southeast Asia and parts of Latin America — and you have a truly global supergroup.\nTheir new album Love Yourself: Tear toppled Beerpong and Bentleys by rising hip-hop star Post Malone, whose facial tattoos are the very antithesis of BTS’s wholesome and meticulously manicured image.While BTS sing in Korean, their style successfully fuses the catchy earworms of K-Pop with hip-hop and rhythm and blues.\nLast year their previous release Love Yourself: Her became the first K-pop album to make it into the top 10 US album charts, rising to number seven. It hit the number one spot on iTunes in more than 70 countries.Hip-hop is nothing new in K-pop, which traces its roots back to the early 1990s with Seo Taiji and Boys. The trio pioneered the use of rap in Korean pop that changed the industry and struck a chord with a generation coming of age in a newly affluent and newly democratic South Korea.\nA multi-billion-dollar, intensely competitive market emerged with stars and bands trained in near bootcamp-like conditions, their images tightly controlled by management.The obsessive nature of K-pop fan bases became legendary, especially the so-called “sasaeng” or “stalker” fans — mostly teenage girls who have been known to break into their idols’ homes. In the last decade or so K-pop has won growing legions of non Korean-speaking fans.\nBTS is somewhat unusual in that despite its global appeal it is not one of the top bands in South Korea at the moment.

  "plain_text": "Kumba Iron Ore is increasingly using technology to improve efficiencies and costs, but at the heart of its operations are people who are putting in enormous efforts during the fundamental tasks of loading and hauling rock – the biggest cost items at the company’s flagship Sishen mine in the Northern Cape.\nLoading and hauling make up two thirds of the cost of the iron ore coming from South Africa’s largest iron ore miner. Since the iron ore price collapsed in 2015, Kumba gave that aspect of its operation close attention, says Mapi Mobwano, the general manager of Sishen.\nDespite a drop in the size of the truck fleet to 98 machines from 136 in the first half of 2016, the mine’s daily tonnage moved shot up 62% to 613,000 tons since then, with a more highly motivated workforce, a better mine design, changed shift systems and improved blasting, he says.The drivers of monster trucks that can haul 327 tons of rock at a time push themselves hard, keeping Anglo American subsidiary Kumba steadily moored in fifth spot in the global league of seaborne iron ore exporters, but their shift system demands working hours that would leave most people numb and bored.\nIn a 12-hour shift, there is a 20-minute lunch break followed by a 30-minute discretionary break towards the end of the shift, but some drivers opt not to take either, pushing right through with their eye on a quarterly bonus that can triple their small salary for the period.  Truck drivers earn a basic wage of between R12,000 and R15,000 a month.\n“This job is not for everyone,” says a driver with six years of experience as he steers a truck so large a series of steep ladders built onto the front of the engine is needed to reach the small airconditioned cab perched high above the ground. “Fatigue is the big thing.”\nThe truck, which has surprisingly soft suspension and rolls like an old scow in a storm, inducing instant seasickness in those unfamiliar with the ride, is combined with an enormous digger that takes three scoops to fill the truck.With the use of an onboard computer that calculates loads and a running tonnage total for the shift, the driver relies on an electronic map of the 60km² mine to find loading and tipping points sent to him from a central office, a huge advance on six years ago when drivers relied on memory to traverse a baffling array of roads.\nThe Sishen mining team will visit the vast openpit Jwaneng diamond mine in Botswana to see how their peers in the Anglo stable are running their truck fleet more efficiently than at Sishen, with a fraction of the time spent idling engines, wasting expensive diesel, for example.With a truck burning through 6,000 litres of fuel in a 24-hour cycle and R500,000 tyres that last about 8,000 hours, it’s obvious why this is an area attracting special attention from Kumba’s management at the 31 million tons a year Sishen mine and the 13 million tons a year Kolomela mine.\nWhile Kumba is well behind its peers like Rio Tinto, which has autonomous trucks and trains operating at its enormous Australian iron ore mines, it has started a three-phase approach to introducing as much technology as possible to rein in costs, boost productivity and extract the maximum value from SA’s largest iron ore operation.\nThe first fully autonomous pieces of equipment at Kumba are drills used to sink blasting holes.

  "plain_text": "You’ve got to know when to go. AB de Villiers announced his retirement from international cricket last week, at the ripe old age of 34. Could he have added more to the game and played more for our country? Hell, yes! Will he be missed in the SA side, both ODIs and Tests? Hell, yes! Is it the best time for him to go? If he thinks so, yes.\nLeave when you’re at your peak, particularly if you know it. There are a whole bunch of very good reasons for that, in sport, in business and in politics.\nIn sport, time takes its toll on physical competitiveness, no matter how hard you train or how talented you are. At some point the youngsters run measurably faster and have quicker reactions to those instincts that make the difference.In business, the optimal term of the chief executive is dictated by a balance of forces that make the deal fair. Beyond valuable incremental experience that you get in the hot seat, there is almost always a vested economic interest in the continued (or eventual) success of the company, through share options or other short- and long-term incentive schemes. But perhaps the most empowering right you have as a shareholder is that you can sell your shares and walk away the minute you have lost faith in the future of your investment under the current leadership. There are no selectors or voters to persuade – your choice, your right, just leave. Not so simple as the member of a team or the citizen of a country.Politics is a different matter entirely. There are, I was once told, only two rules for survival in politics. Rule 1: Get in. Rule 2: Stay in. Nowadays, there seems ample evidence, around the world, that leaders want to stay for longer, if not forever.\nMost heads of state can, constitutionally, serve for a limit of two consecutive terms, ranging somewhere between four and seven years each. If you can persuade the people to keep you in charge, you’re given about 10 years to get the job done, to leave your legacy.\nOf course, there’s hereditary succession, with no set term, typically linked to the lifespan of the incumbent, as is the case with the few remaining ruling monarchies and other family dynasties. I can’t see how birthright can bestow rights of rule, or in any way guarantee the basic ingredients required for the task. I’ve seen far too many apples that have fallen very far from the tree.Constitutional change is required to extend terms, but that usually requires a hefty proportion of the vote. In a state with an already dominating leader in place, that doesn’t however seem to be a problem. Xi Jinping got 99.8% support to extend his term indefinitely, and Vladimir Putin got 76.7% to vote in favour of his second consecutive, and fourth overall, term.\nIt’s wrong, for a whole lot of reasons, it’s wrong.\nThe older you get, the less likely you are to accept and adapt to change. In fact, the less likely you are to even see the need coming. Extended life expectancy serves only to exacerbate the problem.\nIncumbent leaders, particularly those wishing to stay in power forever, see emerging competence and threats in their subordinates as threats, opportunities, and the temptation is to suppress new ideas, rather than embrace them. This clogging of the arteries of the organisation, or team, or country, eventually causes the organism to fail, with the leader.The real danger is that off-course leaders who will not tolerate interference inevitably lead us into destruction, otherwise averted by listening to new counsel.\nLeaders do need time to implement decisions, particularly difficult ones, when you need to change course, as we do. Once a nation has established common purpose and endorsed the strategy of a new leader, a case can be made for a longer term.\nThe challenge is to get to the difficult stuff as soon as possible. To do that, you can’t be in election mode (for fear of breaking the second cardinal rule: Stay in).\nWe’re on the right track, but we’re going to have to fill some holes before we can build castles. So, let’s have the election now, get it over with, and start with the difficult decisions and hard work we all know just has to be done, if indeed there is to be a better life for all.\nMark Barnes is the CEO of the Post Office.",

In what could charitably described as an artist in the throes of grappling with the nature of order and chaos, the comprehensively wrecked singer collapsed on the studio floor in a crumpled heap after countless ruined takes of the song. Then, all of a sudden, he leapt to his feet and threw a TV set at the control room window. Producer Paul Rothchild sent him home like a spoilt child. That night Morrison returned and drenched the studio with a fire extinguisher.

  "plain_text": "Too white for black radio and too black for white radio — an all too familiar refrain, and one that summed up the initial reaction to the layered African polyrhythms of Talking Heads’ influential 1980 release, Remain In Light (Sire). Despite the widespread critical acclaim, the album confounded American radio programmers. But by the end of the 1980s, Remain In Light featured at fourth in Rolling Stone magazine’s selection of the decade’s greatest albums.It makes perfect sense, then, that Benin-born singer Angelique Kidjo, who first heard Remain In Light shortly after arriving as an exile in Paris in 1983, should have detected something in the album’s diverse textures and layered sounds that deeply resonated with her. “Music,” she told Rolling Stone, “is part of my heartbeat and every part of my body. This had an African touch to it.”Kidjo has now recorded her own interpretation of Remain In Light (Kravenworks Records), due for release next month. The project had the blessing of Talking Heads singer David Byrne, who accompanied Kidjo when she performed selections from the album on tour over the past year. “I tried to keep the spirit of it,” Kidjo said, “but yet bring it back to Africa.” \nShe’d put together a stellar band for the project, which included Fela Kuti drummer Tony Allen, bassist Pino Palladino, Vampire Weekend’s Ezra Koenig, and erstwhile Paul Simon bassist Abe Laboriel, among others. There’s a greater emphasis on rhythm and horns than the original, and new vocals in African languages that respond to Byrne’s original lyrics. On top of all this is Kidjo’s powerful delivery.First tasters from the album, Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On) and Once In A Lifetime, certainly do impress. And the original Talking Heads LP remains a knockout.\nBURIED TREASURE\nExpensive Shit: Fela Ransome Kuti & Africa 70 (Soundworkshop/Polygram, 1975; reissued on coloured vinyl by UK-based label Kalakuta Sunrise in 2017)The late Fela Kuti, the Nigerian multi-instrumentalist, musician and Afrobeat pioneer who passed away in 1997, would have been 80 this year, and no doubt still a thorn in the side of the authorities as a political maverick and human rights activist. His output was prodigious; he released more than 40 albums in the 1970s, a time when he was especially targeted by the Nigerian military government, and continued at a rate of almost three a year until 1991 (although these usually only consisted of a couple of long extended funk blowouts). \nCritics suggest the best start to collecting Fela is this release. The 13-minute title track refers to an incident in which Fela had been detained on drugs charges in 1974. According to legend, the outspoken Fela had swallowed a marijuana joint when police raided a party at his Lagos home. Once behind bars, authorities settled down to wait for him to produce the stool that would prove his guilt. Somehow, though, Fela conspired with fellow inmates to get a “clean” sample and secure his release.\nHence the mocking cover art here, with Fela and his gleeful topless wives (he had 28 at one stage) giving black power salutes from behind barbed wire. But the real deal is the title track’s snarky lyrics, in which Fela humorously details the downside of evacuating his bowels. Musically, it is Afrobeat heaven. And the B-side, Water No Get Enemy, proves he was no slouch when it came to deep soul. Copies of the original 1975 release in good condition trade for around R3,000.\nTHE ESSENTIAL LIBRARY\nJim Morrison, dead since 1971, is still causing trouble. Or so his various biographers claim. Most of the quarrelling seems to centre on whether the Doors singer was either the original psycho-sexual shaman and mytho-poetic countercultural satyr of legend— or the original drunk narcissistic idiot of the 1960s.\nThere should however be no debate as to where to start collecting albums by the group he led, and that is at the beginning. Their debut, The Doors (Elektra), released in January 1967 remains a remarkable record, featuring an awe-inspiring sense of drama in iconic songs like Break On Through, Light My Fire, End of the Night and the album’s Oedipal nightmare closer, The End.Fittingly, it was with the latter, in the album’s final sessions, that Morrison’s true nature emerged. In what could charitably described as an artist in the throes of grappling with the nature of order and chaos, the comprehensively wrecked singer collapsed on the studio floor in a crumpled heap after countless ruined takes of the song. Then, all of a sudden, he leapt to his feet and threw a TV set at the control room window. Producer Paul Rothchild sent him home like a spoilt child. That night Morrison returned and drenched the studio with a fire extinguisher. Rothchild managed to persuade the studio owner to charge the record company for the damages — and let the band finish the sessions. The next day they nailed The End in two takes.\nIt wasn’t all downhill after that. In descending order of excellence, the albums to next get are 1971’s LA Woman (Elektra), the last to feature Morrison; the sophomore effort, 1967’s Strange Days (Elektra); and 1970’s “return to form” set, Morrison Hotel. (All of the above have been rereleased on high-quality 180g vinyl in recent years.)There are however several good anthologies on vinyl. The first Doors compilation, 13 (Elektra), was released in 1970. It’s fairly difficult to find, but it was made redundant anyway by 1972’s Weird Scenes Inside the Goldmine (Elektra), a more comprehensive set which included the obvious hits as well as some rarities. It was rereleased in 2015. Look out, though, for the 1985 release, The Best of The Doors (Elektra). There have been several reissues on vinyl in recent years, and this may be the best compilation yet.I’d ignore the rest of the albums, especially the Morrison-less efforts, 1971’s Other Voices (Elektra) and 1972’s Full Circle (Elektra). The 1978 offering, An American Prayer (Elektra), which features old recordings of Morrison reciting his poetry over music by the surviving band members, is regrettably another big fail.CRATE DIVING\nThe current Rolling Stones tour of Europe has sparked some interest in their back catalogue. One oddity is worth mentioning. Their 1973 album, Goat’s Head Soup (Rolling Stones Records, COC59101), is not exactly rare and copies regularly turn up on stalls at local flea markets and vinyl fairs. \nThe original South African pressing is, however, fairly collectible as a novelty item due to the LP’s clunkily censored final track, Star Star — a meaty insider account on the groupie lifestyle. Originally called Starf***er, it is one of the Stones’ raunchiest songs, and was retitled at the insistence of Ahmet Ertegun, who owned Atlantic Records, distributor of the group’s records in the US.The lyrics in the verses, notorious back then, still raise an eyebrow or two today. Among other things, they allude to matters of feminine hygiene, high jinx with fruit and aerosol cans of “tasty foam” and, in what may be seen as a precursor to the modern phenomenon of celebrities dumping their filthy home movies on the Internet, widely circulated Polaroids of an alarming nature. \nThere was a bit of name-dropping as well, like this startling couplet, “Ali McGraw got mad with you for giving head to Steve McQueen/You and me we made a pretty pair, fallin’ through the silver screen …” Unsurprisingly, the band’s lawyers had to write to the film star for permission to publicly suggest he’d been compromised in such a manner. Surprisingly, McQueen gave it.All of which escaped the attention of nervous South African distributors, who didn’t want the song’s controversial content to spoil the local pop chart potential of Angie, the album’s massive international hit. Instead, they destroyed the song’s hook; local fans got a version in which a dull thud had been placed over every f-word in Star Star’s chorus. (There were a lot.)As far as I’m aware, southern Africa was the only territory where this vandalised version was available. Copies of the censored South African album are now trading on discogs.com at around R600 a copy. Imported and uncensored 1973 pressings in the same nick (VG+) go for a third of that.",

  "plain_text": "The opening of Botanical Art Worldwide at the Everard Read Gallery in Johannesburg on May 17 was packed to the rafters. By all accounts, there’s been a steady flow of people through the gallery since that night. (The exhibition closes on June 16.)\nBotanical art represents a crossover between art and science, which has been a prominent theme in recent contemporary art. It also straddles the overlap between art and craft – because what we call botanical art now was for a long time considered simply botanical illustration, a skill purely in the service of scientific study.Recently, however, botanical art is seen very much as art and, as a genre, it is relatively modern. The Botanical Artists Association of South Africa was formed only in 1999. It’s also generally true that the genre has freed itself from its function only as a tool of scientific research. As John Rourke, a former president of the Botanical Society of South Africa, put it in an essay for another exhibition, Exact Imagination: 300 Years of Botanically Inspired Art in South Africa, at the Standard Bank Gallery a few years ago: “Local botanical artists are now creating botanical art for its own sake rather than to illustrate a publication.”\nSo, while botanical illustration was an artefact of scientific study and exploration in the 1700s and 1800s (which has its own cultural baggage), now it serves another function. In the exhibition catalogue, artist Vicki Thomas refers to this as the “second golden age of botanical art”.Botanical Art Worldwide is a part of a global series of parallel events in which 25 countries simultaneously show exhibitions of indigenous plants. Each exhibition screens show slides of works from the other exhibitions around the world alongside local works.\nPart of the motivation for this worldwide event is to “call attention to the importance of conserving our botanical diversity”. In the exhibition’s emphasis on conservation lies the most common explanation for the recent resurgence of interest in botanical art. Contemporary concerns about the environment have fuelled people’s interest in plants.This exhibition, like Exact Imagination, includes works of contemporary art that engage with botanical themes. Among the 83 artists showing are local stalwarts of the field who have been at it since the 20th century – such as Elsa Pooley, Barbara Pike, Ann Harris, Gillian Condy and Sally Townsend – but there are many younger (or sometimes just newer) artists too. (Some of the works by the likes of Jenny Hyde Johnson, Jenny Phaero, Farhat Iqbal, Chris Lochner, Janet Snyman and Sibonelo Chiliza are astounding.) Many of these artists come to botanical art via other disciplines. There are fine artists, graphic designers, ceramicists, illustrators … you name it.What attracts them? You can walk around this exhibition and recognise the conventions from the 1600s or the 1800s … even stretching back to medicinal plant drawings of Ancient Greece. Botanical art might be a genre that fills a new, different cultural role from its original one but it draws on its connections with the past.\nThere is pleasure in admiring the incredible realism of some of the works and the skill that went into their making. But there’s also a sense of vitality that hints at a more profound shift in these beautiful works’ cultural power beyond science and illustration.",

  "plain_text": "When P-Diddy parted with $21-million for an artwork, Kerry James Marshall’s Past Times, at a recent Sotheby’s auction, it was going to make headlines. Knowing the identity of the buyer turned the purchase into a political statement, given it was the highest sum paid for a work by a living (a Jean Michel Basquiat recently fetched $110-million) African American. The stories attached to the motivations of the sellers and buyers of artworks at auctions are often the most interesting and the least known – given few reveal their identities.Herein lie the untold stories around art. Certainly, you would assume that the story surrounding how and why Vladimir Tretchikoff came to make a painting of the Witch Doctor would be more interesting than the its procurement.  Boris Gorelik, the author of the artist’s biography, argues in the catalogue that the artwork is unique. For while it is a completely inauthentic representation (a surprising signature of the artist) of a witch doctor – the artist paid models to dress up in costumes of his own design – it was the only painting that referred to occult beliefs.There are a number of quirky anecdotes about Tretchikoff that relate to his superstitious nature, such as his observation that a pigeon apparently arrived on his balcony on the evening of his first exhibition and only flew away when he became a success. The pigeon’s descendents must be flapping their wings wildly given the Witch Doctor might fetch up to R3-million in the June 4 auction.\nThis will be warmly received by the seller, who inherited the work from her mother. Her identity is not known to this writer, but the auction house was taken with her late mother’s story. Her daughter recalls she was a big fan of the artist – almost a stalker it is suggested.  She would dress up to the nines to meet him whenever he made an appearance at a department store in Durban where he sold posters and artworks. She could only afford the posters, and collected them avidly.  Naturally, it was her dream to own an original. She saved for years to finally purchase The Witch Doctor in 1976, says Alastair Meredith, art specialist at Strauss & Co. \nIt was fortuitous that she did in that year, for it would be his last travelling exhibition. She joined a long line outside the Greenacres shopping centre in Durban to see the work she would eventually purchase.\n“A record 50,000 people visited the exhibition over a five-week period,” says Meredith.\nBy all accounts she stretched herself financially to buy The Witch Doctor, though it cost R2,000 in the 1970s. It turned out to be a good investment.  She must have had some inkling for when she passed it on to her daughter when she died she told her to sell it if she found herself in a tight spot.The R3-million or more the painting could fetch should be just the ticket to help her out of trouble and some. It is the sort of boon “Tretchi”, as he is affectionately dubbed, would have enjoyed, given his superstitious leanings – “it was at a Séance in Jakarta during World War 2 that his international success (as an artist) was foretold”, according to Gorelik.\nIt wasn’t only his international reputation that made his art valuable, but rather his accessibility, echoed in the title of Andrew Lamprecht’s monograph The People’s Painter. The untold story of the anonymous woman who once owned the Witch Doctor painting serves to affirm the epithet. Tretchi would be delighted too, that the artwork is, due to its monetary value, in the same league as some star works by Alexis Preller on the auction such as Poisedon (1970) or Contrapuntal Figures II (1964).• Sponsored text.

  "plain_text": "Non-fiction is still selling way more than fiction. The President’s Keepers is still in the top 10, Wilbur Smith’s memoir is a fan favourite, and Mandy Wiener’s new revelations about the state of crime is disturbing and eye-opening. In fiction, self-publishing phenomenon Dudu Busane Dube took on the challenge of writing a book based on a film.On Leopard Rock: A Life of Adventures, Wilbur Smith (Zaffre Publishing, R295)\nEvery time the novelist puts pen to paper to tell a story it becomes a bestseller and it’s the same with his memoir. Fans will be happy as Smith recounts his life, from his first hunt with his dad to how he worked to become one of the world’s favourite authors.Ministry of Crime, Mandy Wiener (Pan Macmillan, R295)\nPrepare yourself. Wiener opens the backdoor to the world of superskelms: from the death of Brett Kebble to mob boss Radovan Krejcir’s reign and, even more scarily, what is happening now. Wiener says: “Ministry of Crime intends to examine how organised crime, gangsters and powerful political figures have been able to capture the law enforcement authorities and agencies.”Zulu Wedding, Dudu Busane Dube (Hlomu Publishing, R277)\nThe popular writer is one of the few self-published authors who has had phenomenal success in South Africa – she has sold thousands of her popular Hlomu series, which have become bestsellers. Dube’s latest is a standalone based on the movie The Zulu Wedding. She was asked by the the film’s director Lineo Sekeleoane to write a book that would take the film into new territory.Born a Crime, Trevor Noah (Pan Macmillan, R180)\nThe comedian’s memoir about his childhood is a firm favourite. And still selling. Testimony to Noah’s popularity and his poignant story of growing up in the twilight of apartheid.The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Mark Manson (HarperOne, R250)\nA New York Times bestseller, this self-help book has sold over three million copies. Manson says in an interview on the Daily Stoic about one of the sections in his book: “The ‘Do Something’ Principle from the chapter about failure has also been a hit with readers since even before the book. It’s a handy little trick to help people get through emotional resistance and procrastination. Hell, if I was a cool kid, I might even call it a ‘life hack’.”491 Days, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela (Picador Africa, R190)\nConsisting of letters and journals written by Madikizela-Mandela in her 491 days of solitary confinement during her incarceration which began in 1969.The Land Is Ours, Tembeka Ngcukaitobi (Penguin, R280)\nTimely title. However Ngcukaitobi’s book deals not so much with the situation now but with South Africa’s first black lawyers in the 19th and early 20th century who had to deal with colonial expansion, land dispossession and forced labour.5 Ingredients: Quick & Easy Food, Jamie Oliver (Michael Joseph, R430)\nOne of the naked chef’s most popular cookbooks, 5 Ingredients is said to be filled with the easiest recipes to follow. There are 130 new dishes to try out like the Sticky Kinkin’ Wings, Chicken Pie, Mushroom Pasta, and delicious desserts like Speedy Steamed Pudding Pots.The Tattooist of Auschwitz, Heather Morris (Zaffre Publishing, R270)\nBased on a true story. In Auschwitz, Lale Sokolov was the “Tatowierer”, the person responsible for marking his fellow prisoners with numbers when they entered the death camp. He meets and falls in love with Gita, a person he was marking, and promises her that one day they will leave the camp and be together.The President’s Keepers, Jacques Pauw (Tafelberg, R285)\nPauw’s book has sold over 197,000 copies, which makes it one of the biggest selling books in South Africa.",

  "plain_text": "The England cricket team has been forced to deny “outrageous” match-fixing claims after a documentary alleged that a Test match against India was rigged. \nIn an unprecedented statement, the English Cricket Board (ECB) said that there is “nothing we have seen that would make us doubt any of our players in any way whatsoever” in the face of claims of “spot fixing” during the 2016 match in Chennai. \nTom Harrison, chief executive officer of the ECB, said they had discussed the documentary claims with all of the players, adding: “They emphatically deny the allegations, have stated categorically that the claims are false and they have our full support. Neither ECB nor the International Cricket Council (ICC) is aware any credible evidence connecting any England players to any form of corruption.”\nAn undercover journalist, posing as a businessman looking to place bets on the match, filmed a match fixer claiming that he had three England players with whom he arranged spot fixes during the Test in 2016.Aneel Munawar, who is accused of working for organised crime syndicate D Company, was recorded boasting that he has been fixing matches for “six or seven years” and can “fix” up to “60% to 70%” of matches with players in every team. \n“I’m telling you, each script I give you will happen, happen and happen,” he said. \nJust before the 2016 match began he called a middle-man working for the reporters to tell him how players would perform at certain points in the game. \nThough his predictions have not been revealed, Al Jazeera’s documentary Cricket’s Match Fixers claimed that they were accurate.The England  players alleged to have been involved, who have not been named, told the documentary makers that they categorically deny allegations “made by a source who is a known criminal”.\nThe fixers were also caught discussing  plans to rig the outcome of England’s first Test in Sri Lanka, scheduled to begin on November 6, by doctoring the pitch to make it impossible for the contest to end in a draw.\nTharange Indika, a groundsman at Galle International Stadium, was suspended by the Executive Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket while investigations take place. He denies all allegations against him.“Spot fixing”, which hit the headlines eight years ago when three Pakistan players were jailed over the practice in one of the sport’s biggest scams, has become increasingly common in recent years as it is much harder to detect than throwing an entire match and provides more opportunity for bets. \nOne former international cricketer previously accused of match fixing, whose identity was concealed, told Al Jazeera: “They give them expensive gifts, like  Rolex watches.

  "plain_text": "Today in SA sports history: May 29\n1983 — Kaizer Chiefs supporters throw missiles at team officials during their 0-2 league defeat to Moroka Swallows at Orlando Stadium. Objecting to substitutions by coach Orlando Casares, they threw objects including bottles and cans that caused minor injuries. \n1994 — Mbulelo Botile wins the South African bantamweight title in his 12th professional bout, scoring a split decision over experienced Derrick Whiteboy in Cape Town. Whiteboy, with eight successful defences since winning the belt in 1990, had a record of 34 wins, three losses and a draw. Botile never defended the belt, winning the IBF world crown 11 months later. \n1999 — The Proteas suffer a surprise World Cup defeat to neighbours Zimbabwe in Chelmsford. Opener Neil Johnson top-scored with 76 to spearhead the Zimbabweans to 233/6. The South Africans were woeful in their chase, only one of the first seven batsmen reaching double figures. That was Daryll Cullinan with 29. Shaun Pollock and Lance Klusener each made 52, but it wasn’t enough to stave off defeat by 48 runs. Johnson, who took 3/27, was named man of the match. The loss set SA upon a course that would ultimately end in heartbreak.",
