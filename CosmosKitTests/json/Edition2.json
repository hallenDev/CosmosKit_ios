Kataza needs space to integrate with the Tokai troop at his own time. Some residents have been following him since his relocation and we are concerned about this human interference. The city once again appeals to all to please refrain from following or feeding Kataza.”\n\nThe city said the baboon had been accessed on a number of occasions since his relocation and that his integration with the Tokai troop was being carefully monitored.\n\n“He was in a fight with another male baboon from Tokai on Saturday, 10 October 2020. Fighting between baboons is normal behaviour in determining dominance and is part of the process of being accepted into a new troop. At this point in time no intervention is required as determined by the guidelines for dispersing male baboons in urban areas in the Cape Peninsula.\n\n“The city’s baboon programme has been in existence since 2009. To date the programme has succeeded in limiting baboon incursions into urban areas. The intention of the programme is to limit interaction between humans and baboons, to keep baboons out of urban areas where they face many dangers, and ultimately to ensure the safety and welfare of residents and baboons alike.”\n\nOn Thursday the city told  Sunday Times Daily it was yet to  respond to Engelbrecht’s court papers.\n\n“No, not yet. According to the court processes, the city must file its answering affidavit within 15 days of giving notice of its intention to oppose the application,” it said.",
              "html": "<p>“It is the city’s intention to oppose the application,” it said.</p><p>“This is in the best interest of Kataza, and all other baboons whose natural habitat is the mountains adjacent to urban areas in the Cape Peninsula. Kataza needs space to integrate with the Tokai troop at his own time. Some residents have been following him since his relocation and we are concerned about this human interference. The city once again appeals to all to please refrain from following or feeding Kataza.”</p><p>The city said the baboon had been accessed on a number of occasions since his relocation and that his integration with the Tokai troop was being carefully monitored.</p><p>“He was in a fight with another male baboon from Tokai on Saturday, 10 October 2020. Fighting between baboons is normal behaviour in determining dominance and is part of the process of being accepted into a new troop. At this point in time no intervention is required as determined by the guidelines for dispersing male baboons in urban areas in the Cape Peninsula.</p><p>“The city’s baboon programme has been in existence since 2009. To date the programme has succeeded in limiting baboon incursions into urban areas. The intention of the programme is to limit interaction between humans and baboons, to keep baboons out of urban areas where they face many dangers, and ultimately to ensure the safety and welfare of residents and baboons alike.”</p><p>On Thursday the city told  Sunday Times Daily it was yet to  respond to Engelbrecht’s court papers.</p><p>“No, not yet.

              "text": "A brown locust outbreak has hit drought-ravaged districts in the Eastern Cape, a disaster that could clear out cereal crops on more than 120 farms.\n\n“There is a hell of a lot of them. It is a big problem,” said Agri EC chair Doug Stern. \n\nHowever, he said there was a positive to the outbreak.\n\n“After such an outbreak some good rain usually follows and we could then be heading for a good season next year,” he said.\n\nFarms in Middelburg, Graaff-Reinet, Aberdeen, Cradock, Nieu Bethesda, Pearston and Jansenville were affected.\n\nAccording to departmental entomologist Nolitha Skenjana, the locusts, which feast on grasses and cereals, often causing widespread devastation, are now considered to be at stage 1 of their development, with some moving into stage 2.\n\nThis was confirmed by Stern, who said the pests had hatched but were not properly hopping at this stage.\n\n“If they get to the flying stage, they will eat up any grazing and cereals they come across.”\n\nIt is predicted that the locusts will reach the flying stage in about 18 days.",

But whatever he’s reading, he clearly has a very close relationship with his God, so much so that I’m sure they’re on first-name terms by now, cheerfully greeting each other as “Shep” and “Mammon”.\n\nWhich is why I don’t think it’s fair to condemn Bushiri, as many have, as a charlatan and a fraud. \n\nGranted, he did famously predict that 2020 would be a great year, but when you’re on trial for laundering about R100m — a mere four percent if your total worth — you have to admit that’s a pretty great outcome, at least in legal terms.\n\nHe has also been widely mocked for claiming that he can walk on air. Again, I think this is unkind. If I’d made about R2,5bn, before the age of 40, by selling a product that buyers can only test after they die, I’d feel like was floating too. \n\nNo, I’m sure Bushiri takes his spiritual beliefs very seriously.

But whatever he’s reading, he clearly has a very close relationship with his God, so much so that I’m sure they’re on first-name terms by now, cheerfully greeting each other as “Shep” and “Mammon”.</span></p><p><span>Which is why I don’t think it’s fair to condemn Bushiri, as many have, as a charlatan and a fraud. </span></p><p><span>Granted, he did famously predict that 2020 would be a great year, but when you’re on trial for laundering about R100m — a mere four percent if your total worth — you have to admit that’s a pretty great outcome, at least in legal terms.</span></p><p><span>He has also been widely mocked for claiming that he can walk on air. Again, I think this is unkind. If I’d made about R2,5bn, before the age of 40, by selling a product that buyers can only test after they die, I’d feel like was floating too. </span></p><p><span>No, I’m sure Bushiri takes his spiritual beliefs very seriously. </span></p>"

At high school a teacher suggested we remember the difference between the word-endings by thinking of the principal as our pal. That wasn’t much use as an aide-mémoire, not with our kind of principal anyway. I can’t vouch for all his principles, but being pally with pupils was not among his guiding lights.\n\nPrinciple comes from the Latin principium, which means “beginning” or “origin”. The plural, principia, meant the axioms or foundation of a discipline.

In the 1650s, the singular word “principle” began to be associated almost exclusively with goodness or morality. A principled person is the sort you want as your bank manager, or school principal, for that matter. A principled beauty queen would really mean it when she said her abiding dream was for world peace.\n\nWhile principle settled down to live a life of righteousness, principal appointed itself head of everything. This is not so surprising when you consider that despite their physical similarities they have different fathers. \n\nPrincipal is from the Latin principalis – “first in importance”.

I don’t know if the First Nation people would have called Prince Harry a chief during his brief sojourn in Canada, but stranger things have happened.\n\nPrinces and principals may be linguistic siblings, but just like many real brothers and sisters they have little in common. In the principality of Monaco, the principal pursuit of the unprincipled appears to be primping and prinking. But let me not cast aspersions. That was a purely personal and shallow surface impression, as is my perhaps unfair assessment of beauty contests.\n\nI’m sure any beauty queen, or either of her two princesses, could tell you the difference between “moral” and “morale”.
