    "plain_text": "\n\nThe Special Investigating Unit (SIU) has referred more than 5,000 Eskom employees for disciplinary action and investigation for offences ranging from the failure to declare their interests, to doing business with Eskom and leading suspicious lifestyles, the unit told parliament on Wednesday.\n\nThe unit is also investigating 20 build contractors, 14 coal transport service providers, seven diesel suppliers, three coal supply contracts, two contracts for cloud computing and two contracts at Majuba and Matla power stations.\n\nSuspicious lifestyles\n\nHead of the investigation Claudia O’Brien and head of the SIU Andy Mothibi briefed parliament’s standing committee on public accounts on the progress made since April 2018, when it began its investigations.\n\nThe state power producer has been marred by a history of corruption allegations and was one of the major centres of state capture during Jacob Zuma’s presidency.\n\nAlong with allegedly corrupt contracts, Eskom, which has been identified by ratings agencies as the single largest risk to the economy before Covid-19, is also hamstrung by nearly R490bn of debt, maintenance issues and load-shedding.\n\nOut of Eskom’s 43,795 employees, 5,452 failed to declare their interests while 324 officials were linked to entities that were Eskom vendors. Among them, 135 employees were found to be doing business with Eskom, which amounted to more than R6bn. Seven of them have already been referred to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), and the SIU said all officials doing business with Eskom would be referred for possible prosecution.\n\nEskom commissioned lifestyle audits on all executive management and red-flagged 34 individuals for further investigation. The SIU says eight people have been referred to Eskom for disciplinary action, another seven resigned and 19 people are still being investigated.\n\nThree coal supply contracts — all with Gupta-owned Tegeta Exploration and Resources — have been probed by the SIU. One with Brakfontein mine had been cancelled by a court and Eskom was seeking to recover R1bn for noncompliant coal, and a second with Koornfontein was found to have been inflated by R6.9bn after the mine was acquired by the Guptas. Eskom and the SIU were also seeking to recover monies related to the Tegeta purchase of Optimum mine.\n\nIn the probe of the 20 build contractors, all involved in construction at Eskom’s new build plants as well as Majuba and Matla, the SIU said it had uncovered suspicious payments made by contractors to a subcontractor, a portion of which had made its way to four Eskom officials.\n\nTwo of the officials resigned on receiving suspension letters, another left prior to the investigation and a third has been dismissed. They have been charged by the NPA.\n\nIndividuals employed by the contractors have been referred to the NPA, and the SIU and Eskom are seeking to recover several billion rand from three companies so far.\n\nKickbacks\n\nHowever, some of the companies are also in arbitration with Eskom and are attempting to claim R1.9bn themselves.\n\nEarlier in 2020, the SIU’s mandate was widened to include cloud computing and software contracts at Eskom. The finding so far is that kickbacks of R100m were paid by a contractor to a subcontractor to secure the contract with Eskom.\n\nMothibi said that while there was a tendency for people to resign once they had been found out, the unit’s investigations were thorough and aimed at providing sufficient evidence for the NPA to proceed with criminal prosecution.\n\npatonc@businesslive.co.za (mailto:patonc@businesslive.co.za)",

    "plain_text": "\n\n The Judicial Service Commission has recommended that  President Cyril Ramaphosa  suspend Western Cape High Court judge Mushtak Parker, paving the way for him to face two impeachment inquiries.\n\nWhile a number of judges have faced accusations of gross misconduct, none has ever been impeached in postapartheid SA.\n\n One of the gross misconduct complaints against Parker  may have profound implications for Western Cape judge president John Hlophe. That is because it centres on whether  Parker  lied when he publicly backtracked on  claims that Hlophe had assaulted him in 2019.\n\nBusiness Day sought comment from the presidency on Parker’s possible suspension, but it was not available at the time of publication. \n\nChief justice Mogoeng Mogoeng previously recommended that Hlophe himself face possible impeachment after statements by his deputy,  Patricia Goliath,  about his alleged assault of Parker, the use of abusive language and abuse of power.\n\nGoliath had described how Parker had told her and another judge,  Derek Wille, that Hlophe had barged into his chambers “in a state of rage” and attacked him. According to Goliath, Parker said Hlophe had violently pushed against his upper body in an attack that caused him to fall to the ground and injure his back.\n\nParker allegedly told Goliath at the time that the altercation happened after he had “gently tugged” at the belt of the criminal robe of Hlophe’s wife, judge Gayaat Salie-Hlophe,  as a form of greeting. Parker later stated that he may have misremembered the incident, which he had also recorded in a sworn affidavit.\n\nOn Friday, the JSC, a body established under the constitution that is entitled to advise the government on any judiciary-related issues, said  Parker “may have acted dishonestly” in giving contradictory  versions about the incident with  Hlophe.\n\n“By giving these two contradictory and mutually exclusive versions, judge Parker may have rendered himself guilty of gross misconduct,” the JSC said in a letter seen by Business Day.\n\nThe JSC has also decided that Parker should face impeachment over allegations that he and his former law firm partners “may have misappropriated funds of the trust creditors while he practised as an attorney and acted in breach of the rules of the Law Society ... by not disclosing to the Law Society when there was a trust deficit in the trust account of his law firm”.\n\nThe Cape Bar Council has previously questioned Parker’s conduct and knowledge of an alleged R8m shortfall in the trust account of a legal firm he helped to establish. A misappropriation of trust monies, which constitutes a serious breach of attorneys’ ethical rules, allegedly occurred while Parker worked at the firm.\n\nDespite this, when asked in the JSC questionnaire if there were any circumstances, financial or otherwise, that may cause embarrassment if he were to become a judge, Parker replied “No”,  a response that will now  cause him to face a gross misconduct tribunal.\n\nThe JSC  found on Friday that this apparent failure to disclose knowledge of the trust fund deficit was “extremely serious and would constitute gross misconduct on his part”.",

A misappropriation of trust monies, which constitutes a serious breach of attorneys’ ethical rules, allegedly occurred while Parker worked at the firm.\n\nDespite this, when asked in the JSC questionnaire if there were any circumstances, financial or otherwise, that may cause embarrassment if he were to become a judge, Parker replied “No”,  a response that will now  cause him to face a gross misconduct tribunal.\n\nThe JSC  found on Friday that this apparent failure to disclose knowledge of the trust fund deficit was “extremely serious and would constitute gross misconduct on his part”.",

    "plain_text": "\n\nTelkom has asked antitrust authorities to relook at business arrangements between Vodacom and a Michael Jordaan-backed mobile data start-up, a move that threatens to unravel an important radio frequencies sharing agreement.\n\nVodacom and Rain, which also counts Patrice Motsepe’s African Rainbow Capital as an investor, struck a deal in 2018 allowing the former to ease congestion on its network as SA took its time to auction new spectrum by leasing unused radio frequencies from Rain.\n\nBut Telkom, the fixed-line phone operator in the middle of a transformation journey to become a modern telecoms player to challenge Vodacom and MTN, said the arrangement is akin to a merger because the bigger company does not only use the spectrum but also has control over Rain, including the planning, rollout and maintenance of its radio access network.\n\nRain has a lease agreement through which it can use some of Vodacom’s network towers for its services. At the same time, Vodacom has a roaming agreement allowing it to use Rain’s 4G spectrum, or radio frequencies on which data and information are carried.\n\nSiyabonga Mahlangu, Telkom’s group executive for regulatory affairs and government relations, said Vodacom’s ability to control Rain’s spectrum entrenches its position as a dominant player in a highly concentrated market.\n\n“It is the supplementation of the capacity of the dominant market player,” Mahlangu told Business Day.\n\n“It is important that the effects of spectrum arrangements on competition are scrutinised, particularly in light of the upcoming spectrum auction, which will set the ground for the nature of competition in the mobile market for the foreseeable future.”\n\nThe regulator, the Independent Communications Authority of SA (Icasa), outlined plans earlier in October to auction R8bn worth of broadband spectrum over the next six months.\n\nTelkom said on Wednesday it had approached the Competition Tribunal, which adjudicates on all antitrust cases, to revisit the agreements, which were first examined by the competition watchdog, the Competition Commission, and Icasa in 2018. Both found nothing wrong with the deals.\n\nVodacom and MTN have been trying to squeeze more out of the allocated radio waves as an increasingly number of their subscribers use smartphones to browse the internet and stream videos due to delays in the auctioning of additional spectrum.\n\nThat prompted them to strike deals with smaller rivals such as Rain. Telkom also has a roaming agreement with Vodacom under which the partly privatised company uses Vodacom’s towers in certain areas.\n\nBut Mahlangu said Telkom’s arrangement with Vodacom is different. “Vodacom doesn’t control us. We don’t control them.”\n\nNo control\n\nHe explained that Vodacom had no control over their spectrum assets and that Telkom has the freedom to build its own towers in areas where they gain enough customers to justify such expenditure.\n\nRain’s chief marketing officer, Khaya Dlanga, said that the company “competes fiercely” in the retail 4G and 5G data markets, and that the deal is non-exclusive to Vodacom.\n\nA Vodacom spokesperson said the company remained confident that arrangements are not harming competition or constituting a notifiable merger.\n\nIf the tribunal does find that this is in fact a merger, then it may disallow it if it is seen to stifle competition in the market and the operators could pay a fine for not notifying the authorities of the merger.\n\ngavazam@businesslive.co.za (mailto:gavazam@businesslive.co.za)",

At the same time, Vodacom has a roaming agreement allowing it to use Rain’s 4G spectrum, or radio frequencies on which data and information are carried.\n\nSiyabonga Mahlangu, Telkom’s group executive for regulatory affairs and government relations, said Vodacom’s ability to control Rain’s spectrum entrenches its position as a dominant player in a highly concentrated market.\n\n“It is the supplementation of the capacity of the dominant market player,” Mahlangu told Business Day.\n\n“It is important that the effects of spectrum arrangements on competition are scrutinised, particularly in light of the upcoming spectrum auction, which will set the ground for the nature of competition in the mobile market for the foreseeable future.”\n\nThe regulator, the Independent Communications Authority of SA (Icasa), outlined plans earlier in October to auction R8bn worth of broadband spectrum over the next six months.\n\nTelkom said on Wednesday it had approached the Competition Tribunal, which adjudicates on all antitrust cases, to revisit the agreements, which were first examined by the competition watchdog, the Competition Commission, and Icasa in 2018.

    "plain_text": "\n\nZambia has warned it is ready to become the first African country to default as a result of the coronavirus pandemic if investors in its $3bn worth of dollar bonds reject a request by the country to suspend payments.\n\nAfrica’s second-biggest copper producer, which is attempting to restructure its $12bn of external debt, has become a crucial test of global efforts to help emerging nations find debt relief as the pandemic devastates their economies.\n\nDespite the threat of a default, bondholders, who are due to decide next week whether to accept the government’s request to suspend interest payments for six months, said they planned to reject the proposal. “Should Zambia fail to reach an agreement with its commercial creditors ... the republic, with its limited fiscal space, will be unable to make payments and, therefore, fail to forestall accumulating arrears,” it said in a statement.\n\nZambia’s bonds, which are due in 2024, fell more than 3% to 46c on the dollar on Wednesday after the default warning.\n\nIt was due to pay more than $42m of interest on the bonds on Wednesday. It would have a grace period of up to 30 days to make up a missing payment before the bonds were officially considered to be in default.\n\nCreditors’ reluctance to accept the suspension in part stems from concerns that not all creditors are being treated equally. Chinese debts total about $3bn. Some Chinese creditors have pressured Zambia to pay their share of about $200m in arrears on its Chinese debts before they agree to suspend future payments, a demand that Lusaka is resisting.\n\nHolders of the dollar bonds have complained that Zambia, which is also seeking an International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, has not disclosed enough information about the Chinese debts and its wider plans to rein in public finances.\n\n “We have yet to receive enough details from Zambia officials to vote on the consent,” said Kevin Daly, a fund manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments and a member of a committee of Zambian bondholders that owns enough bonds to reject the debt suspension proposal.  “Having a dialogue would be more constructive than issuing press releases,” he added.\n\n“Two big concerns we have are the lack of clarity on what debt relief they are getting from other creditors, and the lack of a medium-term fiscal framework to put the debt back on a sustainable path,” Dalysaid.\n\nOne hedge fund investor, who did not want his name published, said: “The government has provided no credible medium-term framework that explains how the country intends to address the country’s longstanding macroeconomic imbalances and restore debt sustainability.”  \n\nBondholders wanted an agreement to suspend repayments from all Zambia’s creditors, including Chinese and other lenders, said Polina Kurdyavko, head of emerging market debt at BlueBay Asset Management and a member of the committee. “Until we get to that point, it’s counterproductive to consent to an amendment without a plan in place. We would not be fulfilling our fiduciary duty to our investors.”\n\nZambia has said it is seeking equal treatment for all creditors. It said it needed the suspension “to design a sustainable and equitable debt management strategy” as it pursued negotiations with the IMF. In the statement, it said it intended to continue paying debt “for a few priority projects that have an immediate economic and social impact” even as most other payments would be halted. It also promised to give details of these projects.\n\n© The Financial Times 2020",

          "text": "Zambia has warned it is ready to become the first African country to default as a result of the coronavirus pandemic if investors in its $3bn worth of dollar bonds reject a request by the country to suspend payments.\n\nAfrica’s second-biggest copper producer, which is attempting to restructure its $12bn of external debt, has become a crucial test of global efforts to help emerging nations find debt relief as the pandemic devastates their economies.\n\nDespite the threat of a default, bondholders, who are due to decide next week whether to accept the government’s request to suspend interest payments for six months, said they planned to reject the proposal. “Should Zambia fail to reach an agreement with its commercial creditors ... the republic, with its limited fiscal space, will be unable to make payments and, therefore, fail to forestall accumulating arrears,” it said in a statement.\n\nZambia’s bonds, which are due in 2024, fell more than 3% to 46c on the dollar on Wednesday after the default warning.\n\nIt was due to pay more than $42m of interest on the bonds on Wednesday. It would have a grace period of up to 30 days to make up a missing payment before the bonds were officially considered to be in default.\n\nCreditors’ reluctance to accept the suspension in part stems from concerns that not all creditors are being treated equally. Chinese debts total about $3bn. Some Chinese creditors have pressured Zambia to pay their share of about $200m in arrears on its Chinese debts before they agree to suspend future payments, a demand that Lusaka is resisting.\n\nHolders of the dollar bonds have complained that Zambia, which is also seeking an International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, has not disclosed enough information about the Chinese debts and its wider plans to rein in public finances.\n\n “We have yet to receive enough details from Zambia officials to vote on the consent,” said Kevin Daly, a fund manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments and a member of a committee of Zambian bondholders that owns enough bonds to reject the debt suspension proposal.  “Having a dialogue would be more constructive than issuing press releases,” he added.\n\n“Two big concerns we have are the lack of clarity on what debt relief they are getting from other creditors, and the lack of a medium-term fiscal framework to put the debt back on a sustainable path,” Dalysaid.\n\nOne hedge fund investor, who did not want his name published, said: “The government has provided no credible medium-term framework that explains how the country intends to address the country’s longstanding macroeconomic imbalances and restore debt sustainability.”  \n\nBondholders wanted an agreement to suspend repayments from all Zambia’s creditors, including Chinese and other lenders, said Polina Kurdyavko, head of emerging market debt at BlueBay Asset Management and a member of the committee. “Until we get to that point, it’s counterproductive to consent to an amendment without a plan in place. We would not be fulfilling our fiduciary duty to our investors.”\n\nZambia has said it is seeking equal treatment for all creditors. It said it needed the suspension “to design a sustainable and equitable debt management strategy” as it pursued negotiations with the IMF. In the statement, it said it intended to continue paying debt “for a few priority projects that have an immediate economic and social impact” even as most other payments would be halted. It also promised to give details of these projects.\n\n© The Financial Times 2020",

    "plain_text": "\n\nA court ruling has affirmed Eskom’s decision to cut power supply to Walter Sisulu Municipality, emboldening the utility to enhance collection of R31bn in debt from defaulting municipalities across SA.\n\n \n\nIn the judgment, delivered by the Johannesburg high court on Tuesday, the court dismissed a bid by Pioneer Foods, a major SA food producer, to review and set aside Eskom’s 2018 decision to interrupt electricity supply to the Walter Sisulu municipality in the Eastern Cape over its failure to pay the utility. \n\nThe utility described the ruling as a “landmark judgment”, affirming its right to cut off nonpaying customers. \n\nIt is, however, bad news for businesses such as Pioneer Foods, which, although up-to date with their municipal power bills, could still find themselves cut off by Eskom because the local authorities they operate in are in arrears with the utility. \n\n“Having received the judgment, Eskom is now in a position to enhance its collection efforts from defaulting municipalities,” the utility said in a statement.\n\nEskom, which is struggling to contain its own R480bn debt, has already been bolstering its efforts to negotiate the clawback of the money from municipalities across the country, and cutting off a number of defaulting ones in 2020.\n\nIn its application, Pioneer disputed that Eskom was entitled to cut supply to its operations and asked for the utility to be ordered to supply continuous power to its operations. \n\nThe court ruled that Pioneer Foods had no standing in the electricity supply agreement between Eskom and the municipality. The company was a customer of the municipality, and as such had no legal right to bring the case against Eskom to court. \n\nThe Electricity Regulation Act of 2006 entitles Eskom to interrupt electricity supply to a nonpaying customer, and in this matter, Eskom had taken proper preliminary steps and followed due process.\n\nThe court found Pioneer’s application was launched prematurely as it did not make use of an internal remedy provided for by the Electricity Regulation Act to lodge a dispute with the National Energy Regulator of SA (Nersa). \n\nEskom said it welcomed the “landmark judgment” as the court “has set the important legal principle that Eskom is only obliged to supply electricity to paying customers”.\n\nEskom said interruptions of supply to the defaulting municipality were important and necessary for its survival as it could not be expected to continue supplying electricity to a nonpaying customer.\n\nPioneer had also asked the court to order Walter Sisulu municipality to pay what it owed to Eskom. The judgment, however, found that to be “clearly clutching at straws”, as it would have no practical effect. \n\nThe application was dismissed with Pioneer ordered to pay the costs of two legal counsel. \n\nsteynl@businesslive.co.za (mailto://steynl@businesslive.co.za)",

The company was a customer of the municipality, and as such had no legal right to bring the case against Eskom to court. \n\nThe Electricity Regulation Act of 2006 entitles Eskom to interrupt electricity supply to a nonpaying customer, and in this matter, Eskom had taken proper preliminary steps and followed due process.\n\nThe court found Pioneer’s application was launched prematurely as it did not make use of an internal remedy provided for by the Electricity Regulation Act to lodge a dispute with the National Energy Regulator of SA (Nersa). \n\nEskom said it welcomed the “landmark judgment” as the court “has set the important legal principle that Eskom is only obliged to supply electricity to paying customers”.\n\nEskom said interruptions of supply to the defaulting municipality were important and necessary for its survival as it could not be expected to continue supplying electricity to a nonpaying customer.\n\nPioneer had also asked the court to order Walter Sisulu municipality to pay what it owed to Eskom. The judgment, however, found that to be “clearly clutching at straws”, as it would have no practical effect. \n\nThe application was dismissed with Pioneer ordered to pay the costs of two legal counsel. \n\nsteynl@businesslive.co.za (mailto://steynl@businesslive.co.za)",

    "plain_text": "\n\nConsumer and business purchase patterns have been shifting to online buying for some time now, with a growing expectation that anything available in a physical store should be available on a digital one, too. Online grocery sales worldwide, for example, grew 22% in 2019; and Adobe Analytics found e-commerce sales to be up 55%, year-on-year, for the first seven months of this year. \n\nThis trend has only been accelerated by Covid-19, where physical distancing has reinforced online purchasing behaviours, offering retailers more opportunities, and creating a more urgent need, to reach a wider audience than before. \n\nStill, many organisations have not yet fully adopted digital technology in their go-to-market strategies. According to “Remote Working in SA 2020”, a study conducted by World Wide Worx, only 37% of the companies surveyed indicated being digitally ready with digital transformation strategies in place. There is still a long way to go before realising complete digital transformation for the entire business landscape.\n\nThe pandemic, however, has made the need for this transformation even more essential, especially for businesses that want to scale up their operations. One case in point is the franchise market.\n\nAccording to the Franchise Association of SA (Fasa), the franchise sector represents about 14 different business sectors. Fasa’s 2019 survey said the sector contributed R734bn (about 13.9%) to the country’s GDP, including more than 800 franchise systems with 48,000 outlets, employing close to a million people. Many franchises have set up their own platforms to improve response times, supply and demand levels, and customer queries. \n\nWhile this plugs a gap in the short term, businesses need something much more scalable as they grow, which is why Dimension Data launched Commerce Cloud QuickStart.  \n\n“Commerce Cloud Quickstart is a ready-to-use, out-of-the-box e-commerce platform that allows you to showcase all of your products, manage payment and inventory, automate shipping, logistics and communication with delivery all in one. It also comes with built-in search and SEO functionality to reach customers and generate sales,” says Tony Nugent, retail principal practice and solution head. \n\nBy providing an efficient, cost-effective and scalable way of working, one that integrates across devices for a unified customer experience, Commerce Cloud Quickstart helps businesses remain agile and relevant to the ways their own customers want to engage with them.\n\nFor more information on Dimension Data’s Commerce Cloud Quickstart, click here (https://connect.dimensiondata.com/commercecloudquickstart).\n\nThis article was paid for by Dimension Data.",

    "plain_text": "\n\nIt has the Italian resort chic of The Talented Mr Ripley with sorbet shades and summer holiday palettes, and the versatility of a collection that will appeal to a wide range of personalities and moods. But instead of the coastlines and cliff sides of Positano on the Amalfi, the chief brand officer of Boss (https://www.hugoboss.com/men/?utm_medium=displaybrand&utm_source=wantedonline&utm_campaign=sr20_bossindividuals&utm_content=boss_m&utm_term=prospecting_advertorial), Ingo Wilts, sent his collection down an urban Milanese runway.\n\nThough it’s still full of seaside cheer, the designer explained to Vogue that his inspiration was “an early morning walk [he] took through Hudson Yards [Manhattan, New York] early in the summer”. He adds that “the sun was just rising and the colours, especially the blues, were mirrored in all the buildings there”. \n\nAspasia Karras, publisher of Sowetan S Mag, Sunday Times Lifestyle, The Edit and Wanted had the pleasure of visiting the capital for the Boss Spring Summer 2020 (https://www.hugoboss.com/men/?utm_medium=displaybrand&utm_source=wantedonline&utm_campaign=sr20_bossindividuals&utm_content=boss_m&utm_term=prospecting_advertorial) launch and spotted the inimitably stylish couple Olivia Palermo and Johannes Huebl in the front row.\n\nNoting the soundtrack on the day that set the scene, she heard ambient tunes like Wavescapes by Kaleidoscope, which matched perfectly, the sky blue, periwinkle, foam white, limoncello, caramel, beach sand, concrete and then a burst of sunset red the models strutted in, as part of a colour palette not traditionally reserved for menswear.\n\nNow you can create your own story and personalise your own look.\n\nYou could imagine being the architect who loves to walk the city and take in how contemporary buildings stand against the blue sky. You might pick the tailored suits in blue that have great street appeal and accessorise with chunky white Oxfords or white-sole strappy sandals.\n\nOr update your wardrobe with flowing outerwear in glossy, waterproof fabric in red as the painter whose art creeps into his wardrobe. Even the patterned two pieces express bold confidence and a more creative side.\n\nIf you fancied more natural tones, perhaps you would embody the explorer, always in search of an adventure and pick the multi-functional Nappa leather and suede suiting. \n\nLeather may have been a surprising choice for the season a few years ago, but brightly coloured animal hide even when it’s faux, is a big spring/summer trend.\n\nThe highly wearable looks are the perfect examples of comfortable and modern suiting, which combine sportswear and luxury. With a mix of trousers, shorts, parkas, jackets and shirts, even the cummerbunds and thin ties looked very cool. Whatever kind of  world traveller you are.\n\nThe smart-casual ready-to-wear collection has also welcomed back head-to-toe tonal colour or you could choose to layer different tones.\n\nBoss (https://www.hugoboss.com/men/?utm_medium=displaybrand&utm_source=wantedonline&utm_campaign=sr20_bossindividuals&utm_content=boss_m&utm_term=prospecting_advertorial) believes that people can’t be defined by one conventional archetype, but rather a unique combination of countless characteristics. In line with trends embracing personalisation and customisation, they’re encouraging you to pick and choose how to dress as yourself. There’s great freedom in that.\n\nWatch the video below:\n\nHugo Boss stores: Gateway Mall, Durban, Sandton City Mall, Sandton, Victoria Warf, Cape Town, Mall Of Africa, Joburg.\n\nFor more information, visit the Hugo Boss website (https://www.hugoboss.com/men/?utm_medium=displaybrand&utm_source=wantedonline&utm_campaign=sr20_bossindividuals&utm_content=boss_m&utm_term=prospecting_advertorial).\n\nThis article was sponsored by Hugo Boss.",

    "plain_text": "\n\nInvestment holding company PSG has opted to proceed with a R377m interim dividend payment, saying it is confident its investees will recover as conditions improve.\n\nPSG declared a 164c interim dividend for its six months to end-August, unchanged from the prior comparative period, with the value of its underlying portfolio falling by a fifth since the end of February as Covid-19 hit both markets and the business environment.\n\nThe group had a total sum-of-the-parts value of R16.38bn as of the end of August, with its stake in PSG Konsult accounting for R5.76bn of this, and its remaining stake in Capitec R2.7bn.\n\nThe group also had a R1.87bn stake in education group Curro, and a R1.79bn stake in agribusiness Zeder.\n\nDue to share value declines during the period, Capitec saw a fair-value loss of R2.3bn over the six months, Zeder of R1.4bn, and Curro of R731m.\n\nPSG’s sum-of-the-parts value per share was R75.86 at the end of August, from R94.44 per share as of the end of February. This excludes the effects of the unbundling of its Capitec stake to shareholders.\n\nThe group’s share was trading at about a 40% discount to its portfolio at the end of August.\n\n“Despite obvious challenges, PSG believes its investment portfolio is suitably positioned to capitalise on an improvement in trading conditions,” the group said.\n\nDue to its recent corporate activity, including the unbundling of Capitec shares to its shareholders, PSG is now considered an investment entity, and measures its performance more on the underlying value of its investees, rather than their profitability.\n\nThis means some measures, such as headline earnings, are not directly comparable due to accounting changes.\n\ngernetzkyk@businesslive.co.za (mailto://gernetzkyk@businesslive.co.za)",

    "plain_text": "\n\nStandard Bank Group is planning to scale up some of its operations on the continent and further digitise its systems to fend off fintech firms encroaching on its client base.\n\nCompanies such as Ant Group’s Alipay unit are seeking to tap emerging markets such as Africa and its 1.2-billion people through financial-services offerings. This is complicating the strategies of SA banks that have turned to the rest of the continent for growth, as their home market grapples with a recession, corruption and high joblessness.\n\n“What really worries me is you’ve got Alipay in partnership with some of our clients talking about the continent,” Standard Bank group CEO Sim Tshabalala said. “IT is going to continue to be a major expense item.”\n\nLenders from Kenya to Ghana are having to contend with a burgeoning mobile-banking industry that allows anyone with the simplest of phones to transfer cash. Mobile network operators including MTN, Vodacom  and Orange  also offer digital banking services.\n\nStandard Bank’s expansion drive will focus on building bigger businesses in French-speaking African countries and East African nations, the CEO said.\n\n“We want to be at scale to take advantage of the trends in East Africa — especially those in Ethiopia,” Tshabalala said. “There aren’t any specific acquisitions on the table, but it’s quite obvious there’s going to be consolidation as a result of the crisis.”\n\nEthiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is privatising state assets, while opening large swathes of the economy to foreign investors. Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are poised to expand above the sub-Saharan African average in 2021, according to IMF estimates.\n\nVirus app\n\nStandard Bank’s digital investments enabled it to adapt its systems to allow most of its non-branch staff to work from home following the onset of Covid-19, Tshabalala said. IT spend accounted for almost 30% of Standard Bank’s operating expenses in the six months through June.\n\nIt started an app to keep track of staff working from home and to help with daily symptom checks, arranged transport for essential staff, and paid customer-facing employees bonuses.\n\nIn SA, where Standard Bank makes most of its profit, credit growth has slowed due to a lack of demand in the wake of the pandemic. The number of people with jobs in the country fell to the lowest level in almost a decade in the second quarter, while GDP shrank 51% quarter-on-quarter, the deepest slump since at least 1990.\n\n“We will probably only be back at 2019 real-GDP levels by 2023, with employment only recovering to pre-Covid levels by 2024,” Tshabalala said.\n\nThere have been some encouraging signs, Tshabalala said. These include “announced progress with land reform, gradually removing hurdles to increase private sector electricity-generation capacity, corruption prosecutions, and progress with the gazetted infrastructure projects”.\n\nBloomberg",

This is complicating the strategies of SA banks that have turned to the rest of the continent for growth, as their home market grapples with a recession, corruption and high joblessness.\n\n“What really worries me is you’ve got Alipay in partnership with some of our clients talking about the continent,” Standard Bank group CEO Sim Tshabalala said. “IT is going to continue to be a major expense item.”\n\nLenders from Kenya to Ghana are having to contend with a burgeoning mobile-banking industry that allows anyone with the simplest of phones to transfer cash. Mobile network operators including MTN, Vodacom  and Orange  also offer digital banking services.\n\nStandard Bank’s expansion drive will focus on building bigger businesses in French-speaking African countries and East African nations, the CEO said.\n\n“We want to be at scale to take advantage of the trends in East Africa — especially those in Ethiopia,” Tshabalala said. “There aren’t any specific acquisitions on the table, but it’s quite obvious there’s going to be consolidation as a result of the crisis.”\n\nEthiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is privatising state assets, while opening large swathes of the economy to foreign investors. Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are poised to expand above the sub-Saharan African average in 2021, according to IMF estimates.\n\nVirus app\n\nStandard Bank’s digital investments enabled it to adapt its systems to allow most of its non-branch staff to work from home following the onset of Covid-19, Tshabalala said. IT spend accounted for almost 30% of Standard Bank’s operating expenses in the six months through June.\n\nIt started an app to keep track of staff working from home and to help with daily symptom checks, arranged transport for essential staff, and paid customer-facing employees bonuses.\n\nIn SA, where Standard Bank makes most of its profit, credit growth has slowed due to a lack of demand in the wake of the pandemic. The number of people with jobs in the country fell to the lowest level in almost a decade in the second quarter, while GDP shrank 51% quarter-on-quarter, the deepest slump since at least 1990.\n\n“We will probably only be back at 2019 real-GDP levels by 2023, with employment only recovering to pre-Covid levels by 2024,” Tshabalala said.\n\nThere have been some encouraging signs, Tshabalala said. These include “announced progress with land reform, gradually removing hurdles to increase private sector electricity-generation capacity, corruption prosecutions, and progress with the gazetted infrastructure projects”.\n\nBloomberg",

    "plain_text": "\n\nFormer Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi, who gave detailed evidence to the Zondo inquiry about how the facilities management company allegedly bribed top ANC officials for lucrative government tenders, has become the first accused in a state capture corruption case to be denied bail.\n\nPalm Ridge regional court magistrate Phillip Venter on Tuesday found that Agrizzi, who the state alleged had failed to disclose that he had R30m in offshore accounts, posed a significant flight risk and should be incarcerated to ensure that he stood trial.\n\nThe Asset Forfeiture Unit is now also “taking steps” to seize Agrizzi’s assets in Italy, the Investigating Directorate  (ID) has confirmed.\n\nAgrizzi faces corruption charges with former ANC MP Vincent Smith, who he is accused of bribing with R800,000 in cash and benefits to prevent parliamentary scrutiny of Bosasa’s allegedly corrupt dealings with the state.\n\nSmith served as chair of the parliamentary portfolio committee on correctional services. The state alleges he  looked the other way when he was confronted with clear evidence of Bosasa’s graft.\n\nAgrizzi insists he was not acting in his own interest, but on behalf of Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson, when he made payments to Smith.\n\nWhile Agrizzi’s lawyers have previously claimed that he has been working with authorities to assist them in the prosecution of alleged Bosasa corruption, the tough stance taken by the ID about his alleged dishonesty strongly suggests that Agrizzi will not be a significant state witness in any further Bosasa prosecutions.\n\nWhile Venter applauded Agrizzi for blowing the whistle on alleged Bosasa corruption, he found that the state had painted a compelling picture of how he could abscond from SA.\n\nPointing out that the Gupta family's exit from SA had caused serious difficulties for the National Prosecuting Authority in its efforts to prosecute alleged state capture corruption, Venter said: “I cannot contribute to yet another name being added to that headache”\n\nThe prosecution has accused Agrizzi of failing to disclose in sworn bail statements that he had bought real estate in Castel del Piano in Italy for €880,000 in March last year, and had also purchased a luxury vehicle. A bank account in the name of Agrizzi’s wife has a balance of €714,419.50, the state claims. It further alleges that Agrizzi had a large sum of money in cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile Agrizzi stated in a February 2019 bail affidavit in another Bosasa tender corruption case that “my wife and I own movable assets valued at approximately R2,650,000 and immovable property valued at approximately R14,000,000”, the ID said  this is a lie. “The true position is that as at  February 6 2019, the Agrizzis owned movable assets (excluding household furniture, jewellery and art) of R35.6m  and not R2.65m.”\n\nThe state questioned Agrizzi’s claims that he had “lost” his Italian passport.\n\n“More importantly, he failed to disclose that between  December 11 2018 and  January 19 2019, before and while appearing before the Zondo commission of inquiry into state capture, he transferred R11.98m  and his wife transferred R11.99m  to offshore accounts,” the Investigating Directorate  said.\n\nAgrizzi’s lawyers insist that he disclosed his offshore investments and purchases to the SA Revenue Service and Reserve Bank, Venter questioned why he had not mentioned them in his bail affidavits.\n\n“The issue is why hide it? Why not disclose it from the onset?” said Venter.\n\nAgrizzi’s attorney, Daniel Witz, told Business Day that he will seek to urgently appeal the decision in the Johannesburg high court.\n\n“We have profound concerns about Mr Agrizzi’s health, particularly given that he was recently hospitalised and is now on portable oxygen,” Witz said.\n\nWhile Venter accepted that Agrizzi had health problems,  he stressed that “his health concern is not the only factor which has to direct which way the bail application goes”.",

The state alleges he  looked the other way when he was confronted with clear evidence of Bosasa’s graft.\n\nAgrizzi insists he was not acting in his own interest, but on behalf of Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson, when he made payments to Smith.\n\nWhile Agrizzi’s lawyers have previously claimed that he has been working with authorities to assist them in the prosecution of alleged Bosasa corruption, the tough stance taken by the ID about his alleged dishonesty strongly suggests that Agrizzi will not be a significant state witness in any further Bosasa prosecutions.\n\nWhile Venter applauded Agrizzi for blowing the whistle on alleged Bosasa corruption, he found that the state had painted a compelling picture of how he could abscond from SA.\n\nPointing out that the Gupta family's exit from SA had caused serious difficulties for the National Prosecuting Authority in its efforts to prosecute alleged state capture corruption, Venter said: “I cannot contribute to yet another name being added to that headache”\n\nThe prosecution has accused Agrizzi of failing to disclose in sworn bail statements that he had bought real estate in Castel del Piano in Italy for €880,000 in March last year, and had also purchased a luxury vehicle. A bank account in the name of Agrizzi’s wife has a balance of €714,419.50, the state claims. It further alleges that Agrizzi had a large sum of money in cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile Agrizzi stated in a February 2019 bail affidavit in another Bosasa tender corruption case that “my wife and I own movable assets valued at approximately R2,650,000 and immovable property valued at approximately R14,000,000”, the ID said  this is a lie. “The true position is that as at  February 6 2019, the Agrizzis owned movable assets (excluding household furniture, jewellery and art) of R35.6m  and not R2.65m.”\n\nThe state questioned Agrizzi’s claims that he had “lost” his Italian passport.\n\n“More importantly, he failed to disclose that between  December 11 2018 and  January 19 2019, before and while appearing before the Zondo commission of inquiry into state capture, he transferred R11.98m  and his wife transferred R11.99m  to offshore accounts,” the Investigating Directorate  said.\n\nAgrizzi’s lawyers insist that he disclosed his offshore investments and purchases to the SA Revenue Service and Reserve Bank, Venter questioned why he had not mentioned them in his bail affidavits.\n\n“The issue is why hide it? Why not disclose it from the onset?” said Venter.\n\nAgrizzi’s attorney, Daniel Witz, told Business Day that he will seek to urgently appeal the decision in the Johannesburg high court.\n\n“We have profound concerns about Mr Agrizzi’s health, particularly given that he was recently hospitalised and is now on portable oxygen,” Witz said.\n\nWhile Venter accepted that Agrizzi had health problems,  he stressed that “his health concern is not the only factor which has to direct which way the bail application goes”.",

    "plain_text": "\n\nFamous Brands, owner of Steers,  has placed Gourmet Burger Kitchen (GBK) into administration, ending  its costly and mistimed foray into the crowded UK casual dining market that has cost it more than R2.1bn.\n\nFamous Brands, which also owns the Mugg & Bean and Wimpy chains, said on Wednesday that administrators have been appointed, and that there could be an “insolvency sale” of business and assets.\n\nUK media reported that Ranjit Singh Boparan, owner of a British group of restaurants and known as the “Chicken King”, had bought GBK. The Guardian newspaper  reported that the  deal will  save about 650 jobs and 35  restaurants.\n\nFamous Brands bought the upmarket burger-chain in September 2016, about three months after the UK voted to leave the EU in a shock outcome that dented consumer confidence.  The chain has been losing money ever since, and was forced to strike a restructuring deal with landlords in 2018.\n\nFamous Brands is one among many SA businesses that were left nursing billions of rand in losses overseas as their strategy to diversify from the weakening local economy unravelled. \n\nBrait, the investment company controlled by Christo Wiese, lost its entire R14.5bn purchase price of UK fashion chain New Look, and Truworths has written down  its investment in British footwear  chain Office by about  R5bn since it bought it  in 2015.\n\nThe struggling GBK was given a final blow when the Covid-19 outbreak and a national lockdown forced the closure of restaurants, with many not surviving  to benefit from an easing of restrictions in the European summer, and a government scheme to subsidise dining  and rescue the sector. \n\nIt has been further hit by the prospect of more stringent lockdowns as infections in the UK surge again. \n\nIn April, the SA restaurant business said it will no longer send  more money abroad to prop up the chain.\n\nIn 2018, GBK was placed under a form of  bankruptcy protection called a company voluntary arrangement, and restructured, closing more than 20 stores. In March, before lockdown, Famous Brands said the business was on the road to recovery due to  “operational improvements as well as the benefits derived from the restructuring programme”. \n\nFamous Brands has impaired about R2.6bn of its investment in GBK  since 2018.\n\nRetail analyst Chris Gilmour said  the lockdown in the UK was the end of the road for Famous Brands’ involvement. “There was no coming back,” he said. “It could have, but it would have taken time and deep pockets. The burger market is terribly competitive and many of its UK competitors have already bitten the dust.” \n\nThe group  warned investors last month it expects a headline loss  in its six months to end-August, from a profit in 2019.\n\nchildk@businesslive.co.za (childk@businesslive.co.za)",

    "plain_text": "\n\nEarlier this week, more than 100 investors in Europe, co-ordinated by non-profit group CDP, urged some of the world’s biggest corporate emitters of greenhouse gases to set science-based targets on how they plan to remove carbon emissions by mid-century.                          \n\nBefore the call to more than 1,800 companies responsible for a quarter of global emissions by fund managers including AXA Investment Managers, the world-renowned David Attenborough premiered his incredibly moving documentary on Netflix earlier in October about the destruction caused by climate change and a simple guide to reverse it.  \n\nSince then, headline after headline has appeared about how companies from tech giant Apple to banking behemoth HSBC have laid out plans to remove carbon emissions from their sprawling businesses in the coming decades.   \n\nThere will be more asset managers pressing corporations to cut  their emissions targets, more activists like Attenborough documenting how companies are laying the planet to waste, and more companies pledging  to reduce their carbon footprint.  \n\nThat will only pile pressure on companies such as Sasol, which, to be fair, has pledged  to cut emissions by 10% of  the 2017 base by 2030. But does it go far enough? \n\nSasol has more pressing issues now than to worry about what it is going to do about its Secunda coal-to-liquids plant, which has the unwanted  record of being the largest single-site emitter of carbon dioxide on the planet.   \n\nInvestors have been at ease in recent months as Sasol takes concrete steps to pay down its debt load, which was already dangerously high as a proportion of its core earnings but manageable until the Covid-19 pandemic sent the price of oil tumbling and chipped away at its investment proposition.    \n\nThere was no surprise when the company reached out to lenders in June to waive compliance with loan agreements for its 2020 financial year, which would have shown  it was in breach of the agreed 3.5 times net debt to ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) ratio.\n\nLenders also agreed to raise the ratio to four times  for  the first half of the 2021 financial year, which ends in December, giving Sasol  breathing room to embark on a massive fundraising effort.  \n\nIn August, Sasol — which benefits from a higher oil price as it sells its fuel made from coal at the same regulated price as companies that import and refine crude — sold 16 air separation units that supply oxygen and nitrogen to the Secunda plant,  netting it R8.5bn. \n\nAlmost two weeks ago, Sasol announced the disposal of a 50% stake in its Lake Charles chemical plant for the equivalent of R33bn, giving investors the best news yet about its efforts to fix its balance sheet and boost liquidity. \n\nThe two transactions will go  a long way in overhauling Sasol’s capital structure and, crucially, have triggered talk that Sasol might be persuaded to scrap a plan to tap shareholders for about $2bn (R34bn) as part of a  wide-ranging operational revamp that includes  raising money through costs cuts.   \n\nIn fact, some analysts believe that  should it secure approval from shareholders to offload the chemical plant’s stake, the company would be able to push its net debt to ebitda — a key measure used by lenders to work out how well a company’s earnings cover its debt  — just within the agreed ratio for the second half of the 2021 financial year.   \n\nSasol appears to be on track to reclaiming its glory as an investor darling in the short term. \n\nOver the longer term,  the picture looks gloomy. Mounting concern over climate change could put the company in a  tight spot about the future of the Secunda plant. In 2014, Sasol  extended  the lifespan of the plant to the middle of the century.  \n\nAmid growing pressure from investors at home and abroad, and with an increasing number of governments committing to net-zero targets, it is hard to imagine Sasol will be able to keep Secunda running until then.   \n\nWho knows, more and more investors will no longer just make calls for companies to meet emission targets, they will vote with their money; and activists, as some have already done, will put pressure on lenders to cut off funding or demand higher interest.   \n\nSasol’s pledge to cut emissions by 10% from 2017 levels and to link executive pay to its climate-change targets are laudable efforts. But they don’t go far enough if the company wants to be fully aligned with the Paris Agreement. \n\nIt would be painful to shut down Secunda sooner than 2050, but faced with the prospect of being cut off from investor funds or paying higher borrowing costs to lenders,  Sasol might have little choice.   \n\n• Motsoeneng is deputy editor.  ",

But does it go far enough? \n\nSasol has more pressing issues now than to worry about what it is going to do about its Secunda coal-to-liquids plant, which has the unwanted  record of being the largest single-site emitter of carbon dioxide on the planet.   \n\nInvestors have been at ease in recent months as Sasol takes concrete steps to pay down its debt load, which was already dangerously high as a proportion of its core earnings but manageable until the Covid-19 pandemic sent the price of oil tumbling and chipped away at its investment proposition.    \n\nThere was no surprise when the company reached out to lenders in June to waive compliance with loan agreements for its 2020 financial year, which would have shown  it was in breach of the agreed 3.5 times net debt to ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) ratio.\n\nLenders also agreed to raise the ratio to four times  for  the first half of the 2021 financial year, which ends in December, giving Sasol  breathing room to embark on a massive fundraising effort.  \n\nIn August, Sasol — which benefits from a higher oil price as it sells its fuel made from coal at the same regulated price as companies that import and refine crude — sold 16 air separation units that supply oxygen and nitrogen to the Secunda plant,  netting it R8.5bn. \n\nAlmost two weeks ago, Sasol announced the disposal of a 50% stake in its Lake Charles chemical plant for the equivalent of R33bn, giving investors the best news yet about its efforts to fix its balance sheet and boost liquidity. \n\nThe two transactions will go  a long way in overhauling Sasol’s capital structure and, crucially, have triggered talk that Sasol might be persuaded to scrap a plan to tap shareholders for about $2bn (R34bn) as part of a  wide-ranging operational revamp that includes  raising money through costs cuts.   \n\nIn fact, some analysts believe that  should it secure approval from shareholders to offload the chemical plant’s stake, the company would be able to push its net debt to ebitda — a key measure used by lenders to work out how well a company’s earnings cover its debt  — just within the agreed ratio for the second half of the 2021 financial year.   \n\nSasol appears to be on track to reclaiming its glory as an investor darling in the short term. \n\nOver the longer term,  the picture looks gloomy. Mounting concern over climate change could put the company in a  tight spot about the future of the Secunda plant.

    "plain_text": "\n\nDoes anyone have the slightest idea what is going on? On Thursday President Cyril Ramaphosa presents his economic recovery programme to parliament, a first — but never final — exposition of his plan to return  SA to a path of economic growth, and also to present his credentials as a reformer.\n\nJust a few days ago though there was the most awful kerfuffle. The presidential economic advisory council, appointed a year ago, produced a 122-page report urging Ramaphosa to freeze the public sector wage bill, but not necessarily cut back on pro-poor government programmes as was initially planned to meet finance minister Tito Mboweni’s tough 87% debt-to-GDP ceiling in two years’ time.\n\nThen it emerged that Mboweni had requested extra time to prepare for his medium-term budget policy statement. It was going to be October 21 and has now been moved back a week. Why? The timing of the advisory council report seems impeccable.\n\nAt the same time the Ramaphosa, or reformist, faction in the ANC suddenly found its voice, buoyed by a flurry of corruption-related arrests earlier in the month, and began to fling open insults at Jacob Zuma acolyte and ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule. It isn’t just transport minister Fikile Mbalula, though his tweet a few days ago to the effect that “Karl Niehaus is a well known thug employed by Magashule at luthuli house” [sic] will become a classic. A week earlier police minister Bheki Cele was having a go all of his own at Magashule.\n\nVideo on social media shows Cele at an ANC event regaling a cheering, laughing crowd with a story about Magashule and the Gupta brothers. “There’s this one chap who says he was introduced to the Guptas by the ANC,” Cele says from a podium. “Then it emerges this chap is the SG of the ANC. Hawu! Hawu! I’ve never met someone whom the ANC introduced to the Guptas. The other day I asked a close friend of the Guptas how come I’ve never had a call from the Guptas. However Ace Magashule — your SG — he says he was introduced by the ANC!”\n\nHilarity ensues. Cele is not the most attractive politician in the country but his antipathy to Zuma, and now Magashule, is good to watch. Whatever he or Mbalula feel about Ramaphosa is beside the point. They have picked up courage from recent arrests and the president’s casual dismissal of a threatening open letter Zuma wrote attacking Ramaphosa ahead of the ANC’s last national executive meeting.\n\nTo all intents and purposes the Zuma faction no longer exists. It has been replaced by a radical economic transformation lobby, but that too is increasingly ragtag and fragile. Ramaphosa is on top of his politics and the enemy (in his own party) is in retreat. We will find out when he starts talking to parliament about recovery and reform whether he is on top of policy as well.\n\nThere are different views about the delay Mboweni has sought. Some argue the economics has become more difficult. They point to a failed effort to secure a $2bn loan from the World Bank, an addition to the $4.3bn the Treasury raised from the IMF in July.\n\nOthers suggest the delay might be needed to accommodate advice from the economic advisory council. Others say the delay isn’t about fiscal policy or money but about principle, which would be quite something.\n\nBut it is just possible Ramaphosa may use his address to burnish his reformist ambitions. While continuing efforts to keep SAA alive muddy the picture Ramaphosa wants international markets to see, my guess is that he is prepared to let it go if his ally and public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan can’t raise the financing the grounded and bankrupt airline needs to survive until January.\n\nIf it doesn’t work it would be a load off the presidential shoulder. Intellidex economist Peter Attard Montalto speculated this week that while Mboweni might indeed take the precaution to budget for the R10.5bn Gordhan says SAA needs to restart as a new business, he might equally calculate that the attempt to get back in the air will collapse and the money would then sit as a saving to be paraded to the markets as fiscal virtue in action.\n\nBut what we just might witness on Thursday is Ramaphosa casting caution to the wind and announcing a meaningful opening of the economy, particularly in communications and in the energy market, making it much easier for industry to generate power for itself.\n\nThat would be real reform, building on the quiet but skilful detoxification of the land expropriation debate with a new bill that makes clear and reasonable parameters for expropriation without compensation and a new communications white paper that proposes sweeping and welcome changes to cumbersome foreign investment and cross-ownership rules in broadcast media.\n\nIf there’s more to add we will know in a few hours. Ramaphosa has nothing to lose by opening up this economy. He is no entrepreneur, but he instinctively understands the limits of the state.  Sadly, to our cost, he prefers to rely on his party colleagues to find out the truth the hard way.\n\n• Bruce is a former editor of Business Day and the Financial Mail.",

On Thursday President Cyril Ramaphosa presents his economic recovery programme to parliament, a first — but never final — exposition of his plan to return  SA to a path of economic growth, and also to present his credentials as a reformer.\n\nJust a few days ago though there was the most awful kerfuffle. The presidential economic advisory council, appointed a year ago, produced a 122-page report urging Ramaphosa to freeze the public sector wage bill, but not necessarily cut back on pro-poor government programmes as was initially planned to meet finance minister Tito Mboweni’s tough 87% debt-to-GDP ceiling in two years’ time.\n\nThen it emerged that Mboweni had requested extra time to prepare for his medium-term budget policy statement. It was going to be October 21 and has now been moved back a week. Why? The timing of the advisory council report seems impeccable.\n\nAt the same time the Ramaphosa, or reformist, faction in the ANC suddenly found its voice, buoyed by a flurry of corruption-related arrests earlier in the month, and began to fling open insults at Jacob Zuma acolyte and ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule. It isn’t just transport minister Fikile Mbalula, though his tweet a few days ago to the effect that “Karl Niehaus is a well known thug employed by Magashule at luthuli house” [sic] will become a classic. A week earlier police minister Bheki Cele was having a go all of his own at Magashule.\n\nVideo on social media shows Cele at an ANC event regaling a cheering, laughing crowd with a story about Magashule and the Gupta brothers. “There’s this one chap who says he was introduced to the Guptas by the ANC,” Cele says from a podium. “Then it emerges this chap is the SG of the ANC. Hawu! Hawu! I’ve never met someone whom the ANC introduced to the Guptas. The other day I asked a close friend of the Guptas how come I’ve never had a call from the Guptas. However Ace Magashule — your SG — he says he was introduced by the ANC!”\n\nHilarity ensues. Cele is not the most attractive politician in the country but his antipathy to Zuma, and now Magashule, is good to watch. Whatever he or Mbalula feel about Ramaphosa is beside the point. They have picked up courage from recent arrests and the president’s casual dismissal of a threatening open letter Zuma wrote attacking Ramaphosa ahead of the ANC’s last national executive meeting.\n\nTo all intents and purposes the Zuma faction no longer exists. It has been replaced by a radical economic transformation lobby, but that too is increasingly ragtag and fragile. Ramaphosa is on top of his politics and the enemy (in his own party) is in retreat. We will find out when he starts talking to parliament about recovery and reform whether he is on top of policy as well.\n\nThere are different views about the delay Mboweni has sought. Some argue the economics has become more difficult. They point to a failed effort to secure a $2bn loan from the World Bank, an addition to the $4.3bn the Treasury raised from the IMF in July.\n\nOthers suggest the delay might be needed to accommodate advice from the economic advisory council. Others say the delay isn’t about fiscal policy or money but about principle, which would be quite something.\n\nBut it is just possible Ramaphosa may use his address to burnish his reformist ambitions. While continuing efforts to keep SAA alive muddy the picture Ramaphosa wants international markets to see, my guess is that he is prepared to let it go if his ally and public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan can’t raise the financing the grounded and bankrupt airline needs to survive until January.\n\nIf it doesn’t work it would be a load off the presidential shoulder. Intellidex economist Peter Attard Montalto speculated this week that while Mboweni might indeed take the precaution to budget for the R10.5bn Gordhan says SAA needs to restart as a new business, he might equally calculate that the attempt to get back in the air will collapse and the money would then sit as a saving to be paraded to the markets as fiscal virtue in action.\n\nBut what we just might witness on Thursday is Ramaphosa casting caution to the wind and announcing a meaningful opening of the economy, particularly in communications and in the energy market, making it much easier for industry to generate power for itself.\n\nThat would be real reform, building on the quiet but skilful detoxification of the land expropriation debate with a new bill that makes clear and reasonable parameters for expropriation without compensation and a new communications white paper that proposes sweeping and welcome changes to cumbersome foreign investment and cross-ownership rules in broadcast media.\n\nIf there’s more to add we will know in a few hours. Ramaphosa has nothing to lose by opening up this economy. He is no entrepreneur, but he instinctively understands the limits of the state.  Sadly, to our cost, he prefers to rely on his party colleagues to find out the truth the hard way.\n\n• Bruce is a former editor of Business Day and the Financial Mail.",

    "plain_text": "\n\nStruggling regional airline Airlink has entered into a partnership with Qatar Airways, one of the world’s largest carriers, which will see it  expanding its presence in Southern Africa.\n\nThe partnership could also boost Airlink’s recovery, which like most airlines was hard hit by  government measures to curb the spread of Covid-19, which restricted travel. Until recently, Airlink had a franchise agreement with state-owned airline SAA, which has been in business rescue since December. Airlink is one of the largest concurrent creditors of SAA and is owed about R700m in ticket revenue, money  it is unlikely to recover in full.\n\nThe Airlink-Qatar Airways partnership, referred to as an interline agreement, will provide  passengers with seamless connectivity, via Cape Town and Johannesburg, to more than 20 regional destinations in Southern Africa including Gaborone and Maun in Botswana, Tete in Mozambique, Port Elizabeth, Lusaka (Zambia), and Harare and Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe. \n\nAn interline agreement generally means passengers only have to check in once for all the flights on the itinerary, and their luggage is then transferred from one airline to another, without them having to manually collect it and drop it off again. According to the International Air Transport Association, airlines use interline agreements to sell itineraries  they would otherwise not be able to serve alone.\n\nQatar’s flagship airline, which now operates  more than 650 weekly flights to over 90 destinations, has sought new partners and routes after it was blocked from flying to the lucrative markets of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) due to restrictions imposed by those countries.\n\nSaudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt have imposed a political and economic boycott on Qatar since June 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism, which Doha denies.\n\nQatar Airways vice-president for Africa, Hendrik Du Preez, said: “As the most connected airline during the pandemic with a network that never fell below 30 destinations, we strive to continue to offer more flexibility and options for our passengers. We are delighted to sign this interline agreement with Airlink to further expand our network in the region, connecting passengers to more than 25 domestic and more than 20 regional destinations. With the borders in SA being closed for five months, we are thrilled to re-enter the market with additional connections in SA and beyond.” \n\nAirlink CEO Rodger Foster said the partnership with Qatar Airways will deliver enhanced travel options to customers given the designed interconnectivity that will be enabled at OR Tambo International Airport and Cape Town International Airport.\n\nAirlink’s offering of connectable destinations includes most key points within Southern Africa, including Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth, East London, Bloemfontein, Harare, Lusaka, Maputo, Gaborone and Windhoek.\n\nWith Reuters \n\nphakathib@businesslive.co.za (mailto:%20phakathib@businesslive.co.za)",

Airlink is one of the largest concurrent creditors of SAA and is owed about R700m in ticket revenue, money  it is unlikely to recover in full.</p><p>The Airlink-Qatar Airways partnership, referred to as an interline agreement, will provide&nbsp; passengers with seamless connectivity, via Cape Town and Johannesburg, to more than 20 regional destinations in Southern Africa including Gaborone and Maun in Botswana, Tete in Mozambique, Port Elizabeth, Lusaka (Zambia), and Harare and Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe.&nbsp;</p><p>An interline agreement generally means passengers only have to check in once for all the flights on the itinerary, and their luggage is then transferred from one airline to another, without them having to manually collect it and drop it off again. According to the International Air Transport Association, airlines use&nbsp;interline agreements&nbsp;to sell itineraries  they would otherwise not be able to serve alone.</p><p>Qatar’s flagship airline, which now operates  more than 650 weekly flights to over 90 destinations, has sought new partners and routes after it was blocked from flying to the lucrative markets of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) due to restrictions imposed by those countries.</p><p>Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt have imposed a political and economic boycott on Qatar since June 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism, which Doha denies.</p><p>Qatar Airways vice-president for Africa, Hendrik Du Preez, said: “As the most connected airline during the pandemic with a network that never fell below 30 destinations, we strive to continue to offer more flexibility and options for our passengers. We are delighted to sign this interline agreement with Airlink to further expand our network in the region, connecting passengers to more than 25 domestic and more than 20 regional destinations. With the borders in SA being closed for five months, we are thrilled to re-enter the market with additional connections in SA and beyond.”&nbsp;</p><p>Airlink CEO Rodger Foster said the partnership with Qatar Airways will deliver enhanced travel options to customers given the designed interconnectivity that will be enabled at OR Tambo International Airport and Cape Town International Airport.</p><p>Airlink’s offering of connectable destinations includes most key points within Southern Africa, including Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth, East London, Bloemfontein, Harare, Lusaka, Maputo, Gaborone and Windhoek.</p><p><i>With Reuters </i></p><p><a href=\"mailto:%20phakathib@businesslive.co.za\"><em>phakathib@businesslive.co.za</em></a></p>"

Checkers says it offered R1bn back in rewards in its first year.\n\nThis week  saw the launch of  the Shoprite card, which can be used at Checkers, and together the retailers owned by the JSE-listed Shoprite Group aim  to become the country’s biggest rewards programme, reaching 19.3-million shoppers in SA.\n\nOne of Shoprite’s first rewards is a R60 offer of free airtime with the purchase of   Pampers nappies.\n\nPick n Pay’s much older Smart Shopper loyalty reward programme, which  offers discounts of BP fuel, is also impressive. In 2020, it offered R4bn in personalised vouchers and rewards to customers.  It  now offers instant in-store specials. \n\nTo offer unique specials to shoppers and lure customers back to their stores, both retailers use data  based on purchase history.  Pick n Pay’s clever move to offer a free newspaper, the Daily Maverick, with their card on  Saturdays shows just how well thought-out and generous such schemes are.\n\nAs the loyalty cards compete, consumers are set to benefit.",
