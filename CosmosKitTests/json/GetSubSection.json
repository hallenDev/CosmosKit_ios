clear of the Maritzburg defence with just the keeper to beat\u201a but he hardly had time to settle on the ball as home goalkeeper Richard Ofori came storming out of his goals to put the City striker off his stride and force him to chip over the top of the target.\nRoland Putsche got himself into a good position some 10 minutes before half-time to try and profit from Thabo Nodada\u2019s cross but his glancing header was off target.\nBut right on the stroke of halftime the breakthrough came from a corner as Ofori\u2019s attempted clearing punch went awry and fell right for Cupido\u201a who stooped down to head home in only his second Premier Soccer League appearance.\nFor Maritzburg it was their third successive defeat which contrasts with their bright start to the season in the last

following a 2-2 draw after extra time at the Orlando Stadium.\nHe is obviously bitterly disappointed after Pirates let slip an early lead\u201a missed a sitter just before the end of regulation time\u201a squandered a penalty in extra time and were then knocked out in post-match penalty shootout.\n\u201cWe started well but what was unacceptable was to open that zone from where SuperSport score many goals and concede a goal from that so-called \u2018golden area\u2019 in front of the defence\u201a\" he said.\n\"No one was there to apply the block.\n\u201cSecondly\u201a also from the transition we made two similar mistakes and in a game like this one it does not forgive you.\"\nAugustine Mulenga had Pirates 1-0 up after 15 minutes but Dean Furman scored a sumptuous equaliser from the edge of the box with his left foot to level the scores before half-time.\nEvans Rusike then eased through to make it 2-1 to SuperSport shortly after the interval.\u00a0\nPirates were level at 2-2 after a deflection off Gladwin Shitolo in the 60th minute.\n\u00a0\u201cAnyhow\u201a we found the strength to come back\u201a to score that equalising goal\u201a\" the Bucs coach said.\n\"We dominated mostly and we did our best to finish it off before we were forced to go to penalties\u201a which we know is a lottery.\n\u201cWe had a golden chance to finish the match in regular time and missed that penalty.\u201d\nAfter Vincent Pule conjoured up a horror miss in the 85th\u00a0minute\u201a SuperSport centre-back Morgan Gould fouled Thamsanqa Gabuza in his own area with just seven minutes of extra time left to allow Pirates to seal it but Ronwen Williams made a diving stop to deny Mulenga.\n\u201cUsually when you go into penalties (shootout) the team that has missed a penalty during the match is psychologically down.\u00a0\n\"We tried to encourage the players to still go and try and get a victory from the penalties but it was not meant to be\u201a\u201d added the Pirates coach.\n\u201cIt was a good competitive match with four goals in regular time but unfortunately we couldn\u2019t go through and follow our target.\n\u201cFootball has shown us something that is a big truth of the game and that is it\u2019s not about what you deserve but what you get.\u00a0\n\"If it was about deserving\u201a then we deserved more but we got what we got.\u00a0\n\"We are so disappointed\u201a but we need to pick up the pieces.\n\u201cThe league continues for us on Wednesday and we need to find the mental strength from this disappointment to bounce back stronger.\u201d\nPirates host Bidvest Wits

"Holders SuperSport United bundled Orlando Pirates out of the MTN8 quarter-final on Saturday but it took post-match penalties to separate the two clubs on a cold night at the Orlando Stadium.\nThe Bucanneers had the majority of the play and two glorious chances to wrap up the tie but squandered them and paid the price with elimination.\nJames Keene delivered the killer blow to win the shootout after Pirates\u2019 Innocent Maela had his kick saved and Thembinkosi Lorch missed in the post-match shootout for the home team.\nSuperSport started the game in unusual formation by pushing four forwards right on top of the Pirates defence and making things uncomfortable for their hosts but the ploy did not last long and within eight minutes the Buccaneers had their first chance after SuperSport\u2019s new Zambian signing Ghampani Lungu, making his debut, lost possession and Maela finished poorly after being set up by Vincent Pule.\nSeven minutes after that, Pirates had the ball in the net after a series of combination passes saw the Zambian attacking duo of Augustine Mulenga and Justin Shonga combine and Mulenga toe poke the ball to the left of SuperSport goalkeeper Ronwen Williams for the opener.\nPirates had control but allowed their visitors to come back into the game after a fine individual effort from Dean Furman ensured parity in the 33rd minute.\nHe was involved in the build-up from deep in his own half, surging forward to both spray and then collect passes with Evans Rusike finally setting up Furman to run onto the ball and then curl a left footed shot past Siyabonga Mpontshane.\nIt was only Furman\u2019s fourth goal in SuperSport colours but one that displayed both his application and desire.\nBut within five minutes Furman was guilty of being caught with the ball on the edge of his own area, then disposed and allowing Shonga to burst through on goal and it needed a superb tackle from Clayton Daniels to ensure the two sides went level into the break.\nRusike had two efforts inside the opening two minutes of the second half before the third was ruthlessly buried to give SuperSport the lead.\nPirates looked as if they had not switched on after the break and paid the price.\nBut with an hour gone it was level again. SuperSport made heavy work of clearing a corner despite having plenty players back in defence.\nThe ball banged around like it was in a pinball machine before falling for Xola Mlambo, whose shot took a deflection off teammate Gladwin Shitolo and went into the net.\nShitolo knew little about it but, as he had the last touch, it was his goal.\nPule had the goal at his mercy five minutes from the end of regulation time when Thamsanqa Gabuza\u2019s initial effort was saved by Williams and the rebound was there to be finished.\nBut Pule conjured up a horror miss to ensure the game went into extra time, where play became laboured and produced no more clear cut chances.\nThen with seven minutes left of extra time, Morgan Gould tugged back Gabuza in a moment of madness to concede a penalty. But Mulenga had his spot kick expertly saved by Williams.\nThe penalty shootout again saw Williams make a key save to keep up this reputation as the best in the business in the spot kick lottery.",

to separate the two clubs on a cold night at the Orlando Stadium.\nThe Bucanneers had the majority of the play and two glorious chances to wrap up the tie but squandered them and paid the price with elimination.\nJames Keene delivered the killer blow to win the shootout after Pirates\u2019 Innocent Maela had his kick saved and Thembinkosi Lorch missed in the post-match shootout for the home team.\nSuperSport started the game in unusual formation by pushing four forwards right on top of the Pirates defence and making things uncomfortable for their hosts but the ploy did not last long and within eight minutes the Buccaneers had their first chance after SuperSport\u2019s new Zambian signing Ghampani Lungu, making his debut, lost possession and Maela finished poorly after being set up by Vincent Pule.\nSeven minutes after that, Pirates had the ball in the net after a series of combination passes saw the Zambian attacking duo of Augustine Mulenga and Justin Shonga combine and Mulenga toe poke the ball to the left of SuperSport goalkeeper Ronwen Williams for the opener.\nPirates had control but allowed their visitors to come back into the game after a fine individual effort from Dean Furman ensured parity in the 33rd minute.\nHe was involved in the build-up from deep in his own half, surging forward to both spray and then collect passes with Evans Rusike finally setting up Furman to run onto the ball and then curl a left footed shot past Siyabonga Mpontshane.\nIt was only Furman\u2019s fourth goal in SuperSport colours but one that displayed both his application and desire.\nBut within five minutes Furman was guilty of being caught with the ball on the edge of his own area, then disposed and allowing Shonga to burst through on goal and it needed a superb tackle from Clayton Daniels to ensure the two sides went level into the break.\nRusike had two efforts inside the opening two minutes of the second half before the third was ruthlessly buried to give SuperSport the lead.\nPirates looked as if they had not switched on after the break and paid the price.\nBut with an hour gone it was level again.

had been influential in a resurgent performance by Amakhosi as they produced far better movement in their frontline than in a 3-1 midweek league defeat to Bidvest Wits at the same venue.\nIn the 50th minute Molangoane went in for a sliding challenge on Makhehleni Makhaula as Stars' left-back was playing a clearance and the sickening clash saw the Chiefs player stretchered off.\nAfterwards Amakhosi coach Giovanni Solinas confirmed Molangoane's broken leg, and said this was a huge blow to his team.\n\"We are very happy for this victory but we are also shocked because we lost a nice guy like Joseph,\" Solinas said.\n\"We dedicate this victory to Joseph. It's a serious injury. I hope this player can come back quickly.\n\"My players are shocked in the dressing room. Some are very sad.\n\"'Rama' [Ramahlwe Mphahlele] spoke to him [Molangoane] now. He is shocked. They lost a team-mate, we lost an important player.\"\nAmakhosi midfielder Siphelele Ntshangase went off injured later, but Solinas said this was a knock.", "print_priority": 0, "related_articles":

tee, Mamelodi Sundowns were pleasing on the eye.\nTheir coach Pitso Mosimane preaches total attacking football to his players and he must have been proud with the manner in which his troops defended, played the short passing game and pressed Lamontville Golden Arrows whenever they were not in possession of the ball.\nThey did not get it right all the time but on occasions they combined well, and the Brazilians proved too much for this modest Arrows side as they progressed to the semi-finals stage of this MTN8 competition which remains elusive for Mosimane at Chloorkop.\nLast season, Sundowns were eliminated at this stage of the competition by Maritzburg United but this season they have a chance to go all the way with Mosimane having a chance of finally laying his hands on the winners medal.\nSundowns\u2019 fluidity for most parts of this match which sparked sporadically exposed some of the tactical limitations of Arrows who employed a dangerous game plan of sitting back and trying to catch their opposition on the counter attack.\nSundowns first goal was an example of how they got their quick attacking movement spot on as the move involved Jeremy Brockie, Thapelo Morena, Themba Zwane before Sibusiso Vilakazi finished with a close range shot that beat Arrows goalkeeper Nkosingiphile Gumede.\nShortly before they opened the scoring, they were not successful with a similar attacking move that was orchestrated by man-of-the-match Gaston Sirino and Morena as Vilakazi ballooned his shot from inside the box over the cross-bar.\nFor their second goal, they went for a different dimension as Sirino went to the right flank from where he delivered a telling cross into the box and it was met with the head of defender Wayne Arendse who made no mistake.\nBefore the break, Arrows did have their chances on the attack with Knox Mutizwa and Lerato Lamola at the forefront of those attacks but they did not do enough to get the better of Sundowns goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene.\nMweene continued between the sticks for the home side after he replaced Denis Onyango who is recovering from concussion he suffered in their last league match against Polokwane City during the week.\nAs sign of depth in his squad, Mosimane made three changes to his starting line-up for the third match in succession with Arendse replacing injured Ricardo Nascimento and Sibusiso Vilakazi for Oupa Manyisa and captain Hlompho Kekana for Tiyani Mabunda in the midfield.\nWith this a place in the next round secured, the Brazilians shift their focus to the Caf Champions League and they depart for Morocco on Sunday to start preparations for the must win group stages clash against Wydad Athletic Club on Friday.\nThey only return to league action with a home tie against Highlands Park on August 22 where Mosimane will be looking to his second win of the season after they drew with Kaizer Chiefs and beat Polokwane City.\nFor Arrows, they have a few days of working on their deficiencies as they only return to action in the Absa Premiership when they travel to the Mother City to take on Cape Town City on Saturday where they will be hoping to return to winning ways.\nHaving went to the break trailing by one goal, Arrows came back with more intent in the second half as went in search of the equaliser but they could not find the break as Sundowns registered their second clean sheet in succession in all competitions.", "print_priority": 0, "related_articles": null, "count_audio": 0, "notes": null, "companies": [], "summary": null, "syndicate": true,

passing game to a tee, Mamelodi Sundowns were pleasing on the eye.</p>\n<p>Their coach Pitso Mosimane preaches total attacking football to his players and he must have been proud with the manner in which his troops defended, played the short passing game and pressed Lamontville Golden Arrows whenever they were not in possession of the ball.</p>\n<p>They did not get it right all the time but on

opened the scoring, they were not successful with a similar attacking move that was orchestrated by man-of-the-match Gaston Sirino and Morena as Vilakazi ballooned his shot from inside the box over the cross-bar.</p>\n<p>For their second goal, they went for a different dimension as Sirino went to the right flank from where he delivered a telling cross into the box and it was met with the head of defender Wayne Arendse who made no mistake.</p>\n<p>Before the break, Arrows did have their chances on the attack with Knox Mutizwa and Lerato Lamola at the forefront of those attacks but they did not do enough to get the better of Sundowns goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene.</p>\n<p>Mweene continued between the sticks for the home side after he replaced Denis Onyango who is recovering from concussion he suffered in their last league match against Polokwane City during the week.</p>\n<p>As sign of depth in his squad, Mosimane made three changes to his starting line-up for the third match in succession

the Year Bwalya to banned Qatari Fifa official Mohammed Bin Hammam.\nBwalya was also fined 100\u201a000 Swiss Francs (R1\u201a4-million).\nIn a statement on Friday Bwalya said: \u201cI am surprised and saddened by today\u2019s receipt of the notification from the Fifa Ethics Committee adjudication.\n\u201cI have instructed my legal team to immediately appeal this decision urgently and would like to state that I am NOT guilty of any offence\u201a which allegedly took place.\n\u201cI have never done and will never do anything to bring the beautiful game into disrepute and stand by the facts provided by me to the committee.\n\u201cI unfortunately cannot provide any further details as my legal team has advised that this would jeopardize my chances of obtaining leave to appeal.\n\u201cFifa\u2019s decision is not final and I will fight tooth and nail for justice to clear my name.\n\u201cI thank all my fans for their ongoing support.\u201d\nFifa announced Bwalya\u2019s banning on Friday.\nThe global ruling body\u2019s statement read: \u201cThe adjudicatory chamber of the independent Ethics Committee has banned Kalusha Bwalya\u201a member of the executive committee of the Confederation of African Football (Caf)\u201a for two years from all football-related activities (administrative\u201a sports or any other) at both national and international level.\n\u201cThe investigation against Mr Bwalya was opened on 28 February 2017\u201a and focused principally on benefits that Mr Bwalya had received from Mr Bin Hammam.\n\u201cThe adjudicatory chamber found Mr Bwalya guilty of having violated article 16 (Confidentiality) and article 20 (Offering and accepting gifts and other benefits) of the Fifa Code of Ethics.\u201d\nFormer PSV Eindhoven and Club America

He\u2019s got his tactics right\u201a his team balance is proper but they were not biting enough to win the match. Also\u201a the first game is not an easy one in Cape Town because City is a difficult club.\u201d\nMosimane\u201a who got his coaching break at SuperSport in 2001 and stayed with the club until 2006\u201a said black coaches in South Africa are often not fully supported and trusted by their clubs and that can make their working conditions difficult.\n\u201cI think for black coaches\u201a sometimes the guillotine is always is too close to your neck. One loss and one draw there and there is no confidence in the guy\u201a but the others they leave them\u201a\u201d Sundowns\u2019 coach said.\n\u201cI just fight for our local coaches because anyone who comes from anywhere in the world they give them 10 to 12 games. You know the story of Chippa United with Dan \u2018Dans\u2019 Malesela.\n\u201cI am talking on behalf of our coaches. It is tough for local coaches to be trusted and that\u2019s why it is good to see Gavin Hunt and Steve Komphela doing well so early in the season.\u201d\nMosimane added that Komphela\u201a who went three seasons without a trophy at Kazier Chiefs\u201a did well for Amakhosi last season as the team ended third.\n\u201cI have always been vocal about Steve because he didn\u2019t do that bad at Chiefs. I think that he was sacrificed early and I hope he does well at Bloemfontein Celtic for people to realise that he is not that bad\u201a\u201d Mosimane said.\n\u201cI am happy for Aliou Ciss\u00e9 who took Senegal to the World Cup and won a game. He was the only guy who gave us hope.\n\u201cEven on the continent they [African clubs and national football associations] don\u2019t care who does well in the Caf Champions League\u201a they get on the flight to France\u201a Croatia and Serbia.\u201d", "print_priority": 0, "related_articles": null, "count_audio": 0, "notes": null, "companies": [], "summary": null, "syndicate": true, "weight": 0,

appointed Tembo as permanent coach last week after he stood in on a caretaker basis when Eric Tinkler was fired in March following a string of unsatisfactory results.\nUnder Tembo\u2019s guidance\u201a United qualified for the MTN8 and they start the defence of their title with a mouth-watering clash against rejuvenated Orlando Pirates at Orlando Stadium on Saturday night.\n\u201cThey must give him a chance like they did with Stuart Baxter and them\u201a\u201d said Mosimane who won the SAA Supa8 and the Absa Cup with United in 2004 and 2005 respectively.\n\u201cI remember we beat them with Baxter in charge and they never removed him\u201a so Kaitano must be given a chance like they also did with Cavin Johnson and Gordon Igesund.\n\u201cHe must hang in there\u201a they did not play badly against Cape Town City. He\u2019s got his tactics right\u201a his team balance is proper but they were not biting enough to win the match. Also\u201a the first game is not an easy one in Cape Town because City is a difficult club.\u201d\nMosimane\u201a who got his coaching break at SuperSport in 2001 and stayed with the club until 2006\u201a said black coaches in South Africa are often not fully supported and trusted by their clubs and that can make their working conditions difficult.\n\u201cI think for black coaches\u201a sometimes the guillotine is always is too close to your neck. One loss and one draw there and there is no confidence in the guy\u201a but the others they leave them\u201a\u201d Sundowns\u2019 coach said.\n\u201cI just fight for our local coaches because anyone who comes from anywhere in the world they give them 10 to 12 games. You know the story of Chippa United with Dan \u2018Dans\u2019 Malesela.\n\u201cI am talking on behalf of our coaches. It is tough for local coaches to be trusted and that\u2019s why it is good to see Gavin Hunt and Steve Komphela doing well so early in the season.\u201d\nMosimane added that Komphela\u201a who went three seasons without a trophy at Kazier Chiefs\u201a did well for Amakhosi last season as the team ended third.\n\u201cI have always been vocal about Steve because he didn\u2019t do that bad at Chiefs. I think that he was sacrificed early and I hope he does well at Bloemfontein Celtic for people to realise that he is not that bad\u201a\u201d Mosimane said.\n\u201cI am happy for Aliou Ciss\u00e9 who took Senegal to the World Cup and won a game. He was the only guy who gave us hope.\n\u201cEven on the continent they [African clubs and national football associations] don\u2019t care who does well in the Caf Champions League\u201a they get on the flight to France\u201a Croatia and Serbia.\u201d", "html": "<p>Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has urged SuperSport United to give Kaitano Tembo a chance to prove himself.</p>\n<p>United finally appointed Tembo as permanent coach last week after he stood in on a caretaker basis when Eric Tinkler was fired in March following a string of unsatisfactory results.</p>\n<p>Under Tembo&rsquo;s guidance&sbquo; United qualified for the MTN8 and they start the defence of their title with a mouth-watering clash against rejuvenated Orlando Pirates at Orlando Stadium on Saturday night.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They must give him a chance like they did with Stuart Baxter and them&sbquo;&rdquo; said Mosimane who won the SAA Supa8 and the Absa Cup with United in 2004 and 2005 respectively.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I remember we beat them with Baxter in charge and they never removed him&sbquo; so Kaitano must be given a chance like they also did with Cavin Johnson and Gordon Igesund.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He must hang in there&sbquo; they did not play badly against Cape Town City.

It followed an encouraging 1-1 away draw against Mamelodi Sundowns.\n\u201cWe analysed the defeat against Wits. And yes\u201a we made mistakes because we conceded three goals\u201a\u201d the coach said.\n\u201cBut if I analyse the start of the game\u201a we had 75 percent possession. So what does this mean? That we dominated the game [at that stage]. But we never converted the big possession into chances or goals.\n\u201cSo we need to play more forward. We need to play more around the opponents\u2019 box. We also need to improve in our finish\u201a because also against Wits we created chances but did not convert them.\n\u201cSometimes in football one defeat is better than a victory. Because you learn from the defeat. If you are intelligent you use it to improve in the future\u201a by fixing the mistake.\u201d\nStars have harassed Chiefs out of two cup competitions in two years.\nNotably\u201a Luc Eymael\u2019s combination overwhelmed Chiefs 2-0 in their Nedbank Cup semifinal at Moses Mabhida Stadium in April\u201a resulting in a violent pitch invasion from Amakhosi\u2019s angry supporters and Steve Komphela\u2019s exit as head coach. Stars went on to beat Maritzburg United in the final for their first trophy since 1994.\nThe previous season Solinas was the architect as Stars beat Chiefs on penalties in the Telkom Knockout quarterfinals\u201a also at Moses Mabhida.\n\u201cI have a good relationship with Free State Stars. When we played against them in the Maize Cup [preseason tournament in Orkney last month] I greeted everyone\u201a\u201d Solinas said.\n\u201cI have a good memory of them because Free State Stars are part of my life. I am grateful to the team\u201a to the Mokoena family [who own Stars]\u201a for the big opportunity they gave me. I have not forgotten this.\n\u201cSo it\u2019s a special game for me. Unfortunately it\u2019s a tough game. Because Free State Stars for me are a tough team; strong physically\u201a fighting\u201a good players.\n\u201cBut in the last two seasons\u201a also\u201a I think the level of the league has improved in South Africa. It\u2019s a good level\u201a a balanced level. Now in SA there aren\u2019t any easy games.\u201d\nSolinas has walked into a tough situation at Chiefs\u201a who went three seasons without a trophy under Komphela and are expectant of silverware.\nMTN8 quarterfinals -\nSaturday:\nMamelodi Sundowns v Lamontville Golden Arrows (Lucas Moripe Stadium\u201a 3pm)\nKaizer Chiefs v Free State Stars (FNB Stadium\u201a 6pm)\nOrlando Pirates

It followed an encouraging 1-1 away draw against Mamelodi Sundowns.\n\u201cWe analysed the defeat against Wits.
