 "plain_text": "For those who do not follow the Afrikaans press, you would have missed an interesting debate between North West University’s (NWU) political science professor, Theo Venter, and the Umkhonto we Sizwe Veterans Association’s (MKMVA) spokesperson, Carl Niehaus.\nIt goes something like this:\nVenter makes the claim that the Jacob Zuma period in the presidency was worse than that of apartheid-era presidents and prime ministers going back to 1910. Niehaus loses his cool, insisting Zuma was a freedom fighter chosen democratically by the people of South Africa and that by making such a nonsense comparison, Venter demonstrates that he is an unrehabilitated racist.\nThe MKMVA and its allies will demand an inquiry into the conduct of Professor Venter. The management of NWU seems to oblige; there will be an investigation. For days afterwards the debate continues on social media, in print and on the airwaves. For many white Afrikaans-speaking South Africans, including some with very liberal credentials, Theo Venter tells the truth and he should “staan vas” against his critics.\nThere are all kinds of dilemmas with the terms and substance of this debate. First there is the odious comparison of white supremacists who devastated the lives of multiple generations of black South Africans, with a venal, corrupted liberation hero who nevertheless sacrificed much of his earlier life for our freedom.\nHere is the problem with comparisons of this kind: not only does comparing draw moral equivalence where there is none, it shuts down a more complex and necessary debate.\nI felt the same way when my friend and mentor Dr Mamphele Ramphele made the claim that education is now worse than it was under apartheid. I understand what she is trying to say but the comparison is flawed – my students were mowed down, imprisoned and tortured by the apartheid government; there is no way that such a comparison is valid at all. And yet we insist on comparing, sometimes for dramatic effect and sometimes because of moral flaws in the reasoning of those who compare.\nIt is a great pity that in this debate the person drawing attention to the immorality of Venter’s comparison is Carl Niehaus, a man whose very public moral failings give him no grounds for rectitude of any kind.\nIt was the same Niehaus who famously promised to repay recurring debts using an inheritance expected from the demise of his mother; Magrietha Niehaus turned out to be alive and kicking in a Johannesburg home for the elderly.\nYet here you have one corrupt person defending another corrupt person against an argument that Zuma’s leadership was worse than that of DF Malan or HF Verwoerd.What the NWU professor revealed, in the course of the debate, is the troubling ways in which many white South Africans continue to think of apartheid.\nThere is still no sense among our white brothers and sisters of the dispossession, degradation and humiliation imposed on black South Africans over centuries and how that systemic oppression explains the poverty and inequality of the present.\nThat is why it is so difficult to have a sensible debate on the land question. White South Africans really believe that the land they occupy is their own, that it was obtained fairly, and that they worked really hard for everything they possess. Black people, in other words, are being irrational; if only they had worked as hard, everyone would have had ample land and adequate education and healthy bodies.\nWhen apartheid is regarded as mere segregation and its policies as unfortunate mistakes that were corrected by the last white presidents, then one is capable of making offensive comparisons of the kinds heard in this revealing debate.\nNone of this lets Jacob Zuma off the hook.\nHe was indeed a corrupt and incompetent presidential leader who caused great harm to the economy of South Africa and the wellbeing of its people. But unlike his white predecessors, Zuma is being held to account in the courts of the land and might well be found guilty and spend time in prison. The last white leader presiding over apartheid would, on the other hand, receive the Nobel Prize and a Cape Town thoroughfare named after him. Go figure.\nBeyond the debate, what should also concern the public is the decision of the NWU management, under political pressure no doubt, to launch an investigation into Professor Venter’s remarks. That is wrong. Venter can say what he thinks in this democracy, whether it is a personal opinion or a position drawn from research. As a South African citizen, he enjoys freedom of speech; as a scholar, he also enjoys academic freedom.\nWhat the NWU leadership should tell Carl Niehaus and his ilk is this: “Good points in the debate. Now take a hike.”",

White South Africans really believe that the land they occupy is their own, that it was obtained fairly, and that they worked really hard for everything they possess. Black people, in other words, are being irrational; if only they had worked as hard, everyone would have had ample land and adequate education and healthy bodies.</p>\n<p>When apartheid is regarded as mere segregation and its policies as unfortunate mistakes that were corrected by the last white presidents, then one is capable of making offensive comparisons of the kinds heard in this revealing debate.</p>\n<p>None of this lets Jacob Zuma off the hook.</p>\n<p>He was indeed a corrupt and incompetent presidential leader who caused great harm to the economy of South Africa and the wellbeing of its people. But unlike his white predecessors, Zuma is being held to account in the courts of the land and might well be found guilty and spend time in prison. The last white leader presiding over apartheid would, on the other hand, receive the Nobel Prize and a Cape Town thoroughfare named after him. Go figure.</p>\n<p>Beyond the debate, what should also concern the public is the decision of the NWU management, under political pressure no doubt, to launch an investigation into Professor Venter’s remarks. That is wrong. Venter can say what he thinks in this democracy, whether it is a personal opinion or a position drawn from research. As a South African citizen, he enjoys freedom of speech; as a scholar, he also enjoys academic freedom.</p>\n<p>What the NWU leadership should tell Carl Niehaus and his ilk is this: “Good points in the debate. Now take a hike.”</p>"

 "plain_text": "The South African Communist Party has been concerted in its efforts to take on what it has described as a “parallel intelligence service” within the state – one that it firmly believes targeted its leadership.\nAn SACP leader says former president Jacob Zuma was warned as early as three years ago that State Security was embroiled in unlawful surveillance and bugging.\n“All but one of our top officials were being listened to, and this was confirmed by experts,” SACP second deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila told Times Select.\n“I raised these matters with the president about the party’s leaders being listened to. He said he was going to address it.”\nZuma’s spokesperson Vukile Mathabela told Times Select on Monday that Zuma would not comment on Mapaila’s allegations “as it would be premature to do so”.\n“President Ramaphosa has instituted a review of the intelligence services and so it would not be appropriate for us to comment on these matters now,” he said.Mapaila claimed that at one stage he met a counter-intelligence official in a hotel in Durban, and accidentally walked into the wrong room and discovered “that there were people there with headphones, listening in on the conversation”.\n“Basically, my complaint about being bugged was being bugged”.\nAccording to Mapaila, the SACP’s concerns about state security only worsened as Zuma’s battle to remain in power intensified.\nMapaila was the first person to blow the whistle on Zuma’s use of a fake intelligence report to fire then Finance minister Pravin Gordhan for alleged “treason”.\nBut, in addition to Mapaila asking the inspector-general of intelligence (IGI) to probe the origin of that report, he and his party’s leadership repeatedly complained to the IGI about unlawful interception of their phones and surveillance of their homes.\nMapaila says this surveillance intensified as he and other members of the SACP became increasingly vocal inside the tripartite alliance about what he described as “the elephant in the room”: Zuma’s relationship with the Gupta family.\n“When we raised this issue, people were creating the impression that we were being anti-president. But we were not,” Mapaila told Times Select. “And it was during this time that I got intensified threats on my life ...\n“That was when the parallel intelligence system went into overdrive, because they suspected that we have got information so they wanted to see who gave us that information. They were listening to our devices.”Mapaila got additional police protection in 2017 after visuals of a man waving a gun in his direction at a Chris Hani memorial event emerged on social media last year.\nResponding to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s announcement of a review of the State Security Agency, the SACP reiterated last week that “all rogue intelligence activities must be exposed and uprooted from our SSA services”.   \n“The SACP is calling for a similar review of the police crime intelligence, the police as a whole, including the Hawks, as well the prosecution, to establish how on earth the rot of corporate state capture took place as if these authorities were non-existent, and for a firm, corrective action to be taken.”     \nDespite a lack of any action being taken against so-called “rogue” spies, Mapaila is confident that there will be criminal charges bought against those officials responsible for furthering the aims of the “shadow state”.\n“That is the only way things will change.”",
