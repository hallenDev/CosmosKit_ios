  "plain_text": "Anthony Bourdain first rose to fame with his searingly honest memoir about life as a chef,\u00a0Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly, but as his career progressed it became evident that travel was a passion he held just as dear to his heart as food.\n\u201cIf I am an advocate for anything, it is to move,\u201d he once said. \u201cAs far as you can, as much as you can.\u201d\nThe American veteran broadcaster was in France filming the latest in his legendary TV series,\u00a0Parts Unknown, when he committed suicide in his hotel room on June 8 and, while this last season will forever remain unfinished, Bourdain leaves behind a long catalogue of quotable wit and wisdom on the subject of world exploration.\nHere are some of the most memorable things he said about travel over the years, and why we should all be doing more of it.Getting off the beaten track\n\u201cDo we really want to travel in hermetically sealed popemobiles through the rural provinces of France, Mexico and the Far East, eating only in Hard Rock Cafes and McDonalds? ... I know what I want. I want it all. I want to try everything once.\u201d\nOn the tougher aspects\n\u201cTravel isn\u2019t always pretty. It isn\u2019t always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts, it even breaks your heart. But that\u2019s okay. The journey changes you; it should change you. It leaves marks on your memory, on your consciousness, on your heart, and on your body. You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave something good behind.\u201dExploring the unknown\n\u201cTravel is about the gorgeous feeling of teetering in the unknown.\u201d\nOn slumming it\n\u201cIf you\u2019re 22, physically fit, hungry to learn and be better, I urge you to travel, as far and as widely as possible. Sleep on floors if you have to. Find out how other people live and eat and cook. Learn from them \u2013 wherever you go.\u201d\nThe only thing he\u2019d order on a plane\n\u201cScotch on the rocks \u2013 they can\u2019t f*** that up.\u201d\nOn switching off\n\u201cMy brain and body and nervous system, they see a plane ride, a long plane trip, as an opportunity to sleep with nothing coming in, nothing to do. I just go offline the minute I\u2019m on the plane.\u201dHis favourite city\n\u201cIt's so different than the aesthetic I grew up with, the society and culture I grew up with. I compared it to taking my first acid trip: Nothing was ever the same for me. I just wanted more of it. If I had to agree to live in one country, or even one city, for the rest of my life, never leaving it, I'd pick Tokyo in a second.\u201d\nOn review sites like TripAdvisor\n\u201cI don\u2019t see them as reliable, because you don\u2019t know what people\u2019s priorities are.\u201d\nOn his childhood dreams\n\u201cI wanted kicks, the kind of melodramatic thrills and chills I\u2019d yearned for since childhood, the kind of adventure I\u2019d found as a little boy in the pages of my Tintin comic books. I wanted to see the world, and I wanted the world to be just like the movies.\u201d\nDay-drinking\n\u201cThere\u2019s something wonderful about drinking in the afternoon. A not-too-cold pint, absolutely alone at the bar \u2013 even in this fake-ass Irish pub.\u201dHow to solve transport conundrums\n\u201cWhen dealing with complex transportation issues, the best thing to do is pull up with a cold beer and let somebody else figure it out.\u201dThe perils of micromanaging\n\u201cI learned a long time ago that trying to micromanage the perfect vacation is always a disaster. That leads to terrible times.\u201d\nOn happy accidents\n\u201cI\u2019m a big believer in winging it. I\u2019m a big believer that you\u2019re never going to find perfect city travel experience or the perfect meal without a constant willingness to experience a bad one. Letting the happy accident happen is what a lot of vacation itineraries miss, I think, and I\u2019m always trying to push people to allow those things to happen rather than stick to some rigid itinerary.\u201dHow not to do Paris\n\u201cNothing unexpected or wonderful is likely to happen if you have an itinerary in Paris filled with the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower.\u201d\nOn indescribable places\n\u201cIt\u2019s an irritating reality that many places and events defy description. Angkor Wat and Machu Picchu, for instance, seem to demand silence, like a love affair you can never talk about. For a while after, you fumble for words, trying vainly to assemble a private narratiive, an explanation, a comfortable way to frame where you\u2019ve been and what\u2019s happened. In the end, you\u2019re just happy you were there,\u00a0 with your eyes open, and lived to see it.\u201dOn Cambodia\n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve been to Cambodia, you\u2019ll never stop wanting to beat Henry Kissinger to death with your bare hands. You will never again be able to open a newspaper and read about that treacherous, prevaricating, murderous scumbag sitting down for a nice chat with Charlie Rose or attending some black-tie affair for a new glossy magazine without choking. Witness what Henry did in Cambodia \u2013 the fruits of his genius for statesmanship \u2013 and you will never understand why he\u2019s not sitting in the dock at The Hague next to Milo\u0161evi\u0107.\u201dOn Senegal\n\u201cSenegal was a surprise. It\u2019s unlike any country I\u2019ve been before. It\u2019s a slice of Islam that I think most people haven\u2019t seen, with a very different colonial history than a lot of people have seen.\u201d\nBeing a tourist\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid to look like a big, hairy, smelly, foreign devil in Tokyo, though I do my best not to, I really do.\u201d\nOn keeping secrets\n\u201cLook, I try not to fuck places up. There have been times where we deliberately shoot [a neighbourhood bar] in such a way that you'll never find it.\u201d\n\u2013 \u00a9 The Daily Telegraph",

  "plain_text": "Six or so years ago, a wealthy American sexagenarian called Dan Cathy was quoted as making some inflammatory statements to a random evangelical news service called the Baptist Press. Before this week, I had never heard of the man whom I\u2019ve since found out is the CEO of the fast food chain Chick-fil-A, and life was a little less sour before I learnt of him.\nI shouldn\u2019t care \u2013 his franchise hasn\u2019t made its way into South Africa (yet), and it is unlikely that I would ever interact with the man, or his products.\nBut according to Slate magazine, Cathy told Baptist Press that Chick-fil-A \u201cwas \u2018guilty as charged\u2019 when it came to endorsing the biblical view of traditional marriage\u201d. He reportedly went on to opine on the legalisation of same-sex marriage, saying: \u201cI think we are inviting God\u2019s judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at Him and say \u2018we know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage\u2019, and I pray God\u2019s mercy on our generation that has such a prideful, arrogant attitude to think that we have the audacity to define what marriage is about\u201d.It turns out some of the company\u2019s profits are dedicated to funding many racist and segregationist hate groups in the US.\nEven then, we were doing well without the knowledge of this grisly man\u2019s existence and his shenanigans.\nHowever, I had to find out why Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey\u2019s seemingly innocuous tweet about receiving a 10% discount on his Chick-fil-A order (eventually paying R373.15 rather rather R414.50) had riled so many people on the timeline. When the CEO of Twitter is getting dragged on his own platform, you\u2019ve got to get some popcorn and wine and take a \u201cscroll\u201d down the Twitter streets.\nFormer CNN anchor Soledad O\u2019Brien was quick to call Dorsey out on his blunder, tweeting (where else would this exchange occur?): \u201cThis is an interesting company to boost during Pride month, @jack.\u201d\nThe 41-year-old, who has been at the helm of Twitter for three years this month, responded (without deleting his tweet) that O\u2019Brien was \u201cright\u201d, and that he \u201ccompletely forgot about their background\u201d.\nCEO with conscience\nImmediately after this incident, I found myself going back to reading up on Google CEO Sundar Pichai, the man who was named the Most Reputable CEO in the World. Google\u2019s organisational culture was also the subject of a case study in my most recent varsity module, and so his approach to business and relationships with customers and Google\u2019s myriad stakeholders remains crisp in the mind.\nThe Reputation Institute \u2013 seen as the world\u2019s leading provider of reputation measurement, management and intelligence services \u2013 said Pichai stood out for his responsible leadership and was viewed as excellent on the merits of fiscal, social and environmental responsibility. Its \u201cCEO RepTrak is based on more than 28,000 individual ratings collected in the first quarter of 2018 across the G15 economies\u201d and includes \u201cunique insights into the dynamics behind reputational impact\u201d.Stephen Hahn-Griffiths, the chief reputation officer at the Reputation Institute, said of the study: \u201cThe rubric for what it takes to be a great leader is quickly shifting. Assessing a CEO\u2019s performance based solely on financial returns is no longer enough. There is a new era emerging in which the intangibles of reputation are driving political, social and economic change, and giving CEOs reason to reconsider their role as a leader. To be relevant as a contemporary leader today, you need to be a CEO with conscience.\u201d\nPichai talks about \u201clearning to let go and really empowering people at all levels of the organisation, and trusting them to do the right thing\u201d, that \u201cas a leader, a lot of your job is to make those people successful ... and removing barriers so that they can be successful\u201d.\nHe talks about \u201cbuilding organisations where people want to work together, setting up collaborative cultures\u201d \u2013 almost always, the employees are locked in, the product is better, and the consumers notice and pay you back in loyalty.Now, this might all seem like an entirely over-the-top reaction (on my part) to Dorsey\u2019s tweet, but it all sparked a realisation that, perhaps, only a few CEOs get this.\nAt the beginning of March, Twitter released its request for proposals on how best to deal with its many issues. The company said in its blog: \u201cTwitter\u2019s health will be built and measured by how we help encourage more healthy debate, conversations and critical thinking; conversely, abuse, spam and manipulation will detract from it. We are looking to partner with outside experts to help us identify how we measure the health of Twitter, keep us accountable to share our progress with the world and establish a way forward for the long term.\u201d\nThis was a great move, aimed at showing that the company acknowledged that it had problems. But Dorsey\u2019s recent gaffe may have only served to undo all of that, and compound the image issues the company has been facing in recent times.",

  "plain_text": "In some really cool new research \u2013 which, let\u2019s be honest, you probably haven\u2019t heard of \u2013 scientists have discovered there is a precise point at which a hipster fad tips into the mainstream, thereby losing all that made it cool in the first place.\nPublished in the journal\u00a0Science, the study found that social trends enter the mainstream when about a quarter of the population adopts them. It could explain how activism can create tectonic shifts in public opinion, but it also just gives us an excellent excuse to ponder the current state of the \u201ccool cliff\u201d.\nSo, which trends are currently safely below the 25% cut-off, keeping their cool factor? What\u2019s teetering on the precipice of naff, and what can we happily euthanase now it\u2019s gone irretrievably mainstream?\nSo cool right now\nOff-griddingIt\u2019s difficult to begin a list of cool things with the words \u201cSimon Cowell does it, so ... \u201d and expect people to muster any respect for your opinions. But while the ape-chested, flares-wearing, cuboid-headed media mogul might be untrendy in every\u00a0way,\u00a0his announcement last week that he hasn\u2019t used a cellphone in 10 months\u00a0is as right-on as it comes.\nGoing off-grid for the sake of your mental health certainly makes a lot more sense than its predecessor, \u201cdownloading an app to help you meditate\u201d. Odd as it is, do what Simon says, be more Cowell.\nGeraniums\nYour grandmother\u2019s favourite flowers were long considered about as hip as asbestos, and more used to serving as head-height ashtrays in pub hanging baskets than appearing anywhere stylish, but they\u2019re now the hipster gardener\u2019s plant of choice. London East End florist Grace and Thorn, Instagram\u2019s most cherished edgy botanists, even brought them to the Chelsea Flower Show this year. It\u2019s a renaissance, but will they last the season?\nBooze-free booze\nDry drinking is just so now. Gin that\u2019s 0% proof? Count the millennials in. Drinking booze-free\u00a0just for the sake of it? A booming trend in Japan. All the sophistication of a real drink, but no chance of leading you into a hangover, or a kebab shop, or, come to think of it, any fun.Mo Salah\nOnce in a blue moon a footballer comes along who is so darn likeable that not only do opposition fans admire him, but even people with no interest in the sport perk up. Liverpool\u2019s Egyptian sensation Salah, who scored a record 32 goals last season, is that man of the moment. He\u2019s hard-working, smiles a lot, has a name that fits almost any chant, and is so good that Liverpool fans have promised to convert to Islam if he carries on this way.\u00a0\nJust about keeping their cool\nSliders\nTo the uninitiated, these are\u00a0the slip-on sandals you might wear around a swimming pool\u00a0to avoid verrucas. Except now they\u2019re everywhere, leading to a non-ironic resurgence for the standard-bearer of uncool, socks with sandals. It\u2019s a bold step so don\u2019t bother. They\u2019ll be out again by Christmas.\nThe Handmaid's TaleThis time last year, the reaction to Hulu\u2019s big-budget adaptation of Margaret Atwood\u2019s dystopian novel was as if television itself had peaked. Elisabeth Moss\u2019s performance was mesmerising, the subject matter was eerily prescient, and even the music was immaculately chosen. Now we\u2019re into the second season, the praise has\u00a0cooled significantly.\u00a0Have people started turning Off(red)?\nLisbon\nPortugal\u2019s capital has been having a moment of late, and now counts Madonna and Michael Fassbender among its residents. But\u00a0such is the popularity of the place for Britons\u00a0as a weekend getaway, stag and hen party venue, and mainstay on \u201cEurope\u2019s most underrated destinations\u201d lists, that it is now as mainstream as Malaga. (The hipsters are now going to Albania, by the way.)\nVeganism\nLike atheists or swingers, vegans can barely get through three sentences without informing you they are, in fact, just so you know, vegans. Once, this would have elicited a reaction of \u201cOh, really?\u201d, which is exactly what they want you to say. In 2018, though, when vegans are 10-a-penny, the admission gets nothing more than a shrug. You\u2019re a vegan? Aren\u2019t we all.\nCooled right down\nSucculentsIn 2015, having a succulent or two at home was the modern equivalent of having a SodaStream in the 80s, and just about as pointless. Yet, just as those little desk cacti have taken over Instagram, they\u2019ve also fallen off the mainstream cliff, never to return. Trade them for geraniums if you know what\u2019s good.\nHygge\nThe Danish term defined as \u201ca quality of cosiness and comfortable conviviality that engenders a feeling of contentment or wellbeing\u201d is now\u00a02016. What even was it again? Burning a load of candles and going to bed? You can tell the Danes invented that before the world fell apart.\nUnicornsJust this week, unicorns made up a third of\u00a0Argos\u2019 top 10 toy list for 2018,\u00a0which is about as clear a sign something\u2019s gone mainstream as you can get. Millennial parents are to blame, because they always are, but there\u2019s no denying it. Perhaps when unicorns appeared in the writings of Ctesias and Pliny the Elder they were hipsterish and new, but not now they\u2019re a \u00a3230 electric ride-on toy, though.\nFrench bulldogsIf you haven\u2019t noticed the plague of French bulldogs in this country, you have obviously been spending too much time in Albania (see above, and congratulations). With their scrunched-up little faces, bow legs and \u201chelp me\u201d eyes,\u00a0French bulldogs are now the most in-demand breed in the country. Avoid, for reasons of both taste and animal welfare.\n\u2013 \u00a9 The Daily Telegraph",

  "plain_text": "Siya Kolisi's Springboks have united us. The ANC is battling for unity. The United States of America have threatened the unity of the Western world, and Europe must unite or fade. Will North and South Korea unite?\nUnity. It's everywhere, presented in a thousand speeches and news reports and films and television shows as something to strive for. Unity, we are told, is our collective shield against anarchy. Unity is a home in which all are welcome. Unity is a serene state of being in a scary and fractured world.\nIt all seems to make a certain sense. Unity has many real advantages. For starters, it feels fantastic. Roaring in unison with a legion of fellow roarers ignites the blood and explodes the brain. It allows one a taste of primal bliss, when we all sat in the forest canopy and whooped our gratitude at the euphoric dawn.\nThere are also practical benefits, like concentrated human settlement, which gave us division of labour, which gave us specialisation, which gave us the greatest invention of the last four billion years: dentistry. (Future generations of anthropologists will prove that we invented the idea of God was because we invented the idea of hell, and we invented hell because toothache had to come from somewhere, right?)\nWhich is why, on balance, I would prefer to live in a society that is more unified than it is splintered, or at least have the freedom to live as close to the city wall as I can stomach.\nI remain, however, very, very cautious of fetishising unity and accepting it, uncritically, as a universal good. Unity can be admirable. It can be moving. It can force progressive change. But ultimately it is an idea wielded as a weapon by old, entrenched, hegemonic power.As such, it is something I treat with extreme caution. When I read that we need to unite against this or that social scourge, or unite to save South Africa, or unite to support some or other sports team, I try to remember that such exhortations are thousands of years old. The alleged benefits of unity \u2013 safety, strength in numbers, belonging, utopia, heaven \u2013 have been dangled by powerful and cynical men in front or frightened people since Babylon. Come inside the walls and be cared far. Serve the king and be fed. Submit to the empire and be safe. Pray to the one god and find love.\nThe basic problem with unity, of course, is that it doesn\u2019t mean unity. It certainly doesn\u2019t mean a common humanity, or genuine compassion, or an attempt to understand the human condition.\u00a0 All it means is picking teams. Unity, by definition, implies the existence of people living outside the wall. After all, if there were nobody outside the wall you wouldn\u2019t be unified, you\u2019d just be. And as soon as you have people outside the wall, you have power playing its games.\nAll of which is why I don\u2019t believe that South Africa needs unity. What South Africa needs is education. It needs jobs. It needs security. It needs hard-working, dedicated, skilful people. It needs compassion in industrial quantities. It needs courage. It needs luck.\nWithout those, unity is not just futile but dangerous. Without intelligence, skill, compassion and talent, unity quickly becomes dogma, and then a uniform, and then a collective departure from humanity. You know who were really, properly, intensely united? The Golden Horde. The Spanish Inquisition. The Nazis. Those guys could stand together like nobody\u2019s business.To embrace the idea of unity without examining what we mean by it, or who is using the word, is to be unwittingly complicit in the eroding of individual rights. Enthusing about the unity of a nation state feels good and affirming (the ancient architects of multi-generational power knew plenty about human psychology), but when unity requires the silencing of dissent, or giving up certain liberties in return for safety or acceptance, or the abandonment of a wide range of thoughts and beliefs in favour of an easily-digested middle-ground pap, then unity really just means surrender.\nSouth Africa is not unified. We speak many languages. We imagine many futures. We worship many gods, or none at all. Our randomly drawn border encircles a multitude of nations and histories and realities. We are a big, noisy, exuberant, angry, beautiful, rich, poor, horrifying mess. We need to work. We need to elect people who know how to get stuff done. We need a break.\nBut unity? May God and the ancestors and the many gods and the spirits and the saints and the fairies and the flying spaghetti monster save us from such a fate.",

  "plain_text": "If the only way to get your car instalment down to a number you can afford every month is to carve out about a third of the total\u00a0amount owing on\u00a0the financed deal as a \u201cballoon payment\u201d, you really can\u2019t afford those wheels and\u00a0should opt for something cheaper.\nThat\u2019s good advice, but given that car prices have increased between 30% and 40% in the past two to three years, along with the price of petrol and insurance, buying with \u201ca balloon\u201d is the\u00a0only option for increasing numbers of South African motorists.\nFirst-time car buyer Dudu Koloi bought a new Kia Rio from a Kia dealership in Gauteng in May 2016 but only recently discovered that after she\u2019s paid her R4,700 a month for another four years \u2013 six years in total \u2013 she will still owe R70,500 on the car.\u00a0\nShe was horrified, and adamant that no one at the dealership had said a word about a balloon payment. \u201cThey just talked about the contract being for 72 months.\u201dBut she signed the contract, so she must have known, surely?\nWell, yes, she did sign a Motor Finance Corporation (MFC) contract which discloses that very large final payment, but not in a way that\u2019s very easy for an inexperienced first-time buyer to\u00a0notice.\nIt\u2019s in tiny print, not highlighted in any way, and the customer is not asked to initial next to it to ensure that they realise what they\u2019re committing to.\n\u201cIf I\u2019d known about the balloon payment I wouldn\u2019t have taken the car,\u201d Koloi said. \u201cAnd I have since discovered that many people get into these balloon payment deals without realising it.\u00a0I have a baby now who I need to save money for and this is putting me in a difficult position. I cannot afford such an exorbitant amount.\u201d\nWith VAT and R17,000 of extras (that\u2019s another story) the\u00a0price of the car was R255,000. With interest, that swelled to R406,000. Off came that \u201cballoon payment\u201d, leaving her with\u00a0around R330,000 to divide into payments over six years.Responding, Trevor Browse, managing executive of Nedbank division MFC, said Koloi had signed both the pre-agreement quote and the instalment sale agreement acknowledging that\u00a0her last payment was different from the regular monthly payments.\nThe person who had arranged her financing no longer works at the dealership, he said, \u201cso we are not in a position to confirm the detail of their face-to-face discussion\u201d.\nBut after a client has bought a new vehicle, he said, \u201cwe schedule a welcome phone call, which is recorded, to explain and confirm the interest rate, term structure of the loan, balloon\u00a0payment amount and date, monthly instalment amount at the current interest rate, and proof of insurance\u201d.But Koloi insisted that no such discussion took place, and requested the call recording.\nThen Browse said this: \u201cThe head of MFC client services has listened to the welcome call to Ms Koloi in 2016, a few days after she took delivery of the car.\u00a0While the specific conversation did not detail the finance agreements, the agent did advise and confirm that the final agreement would be sent to Ms Koloi for her records.\u201dRight.\nSo what now for Koloi?\u00a0\nWhen she\u2019s done paying R4,700 for six years, she can apply to re-finance that R70,000 still owing, in which case she\u2019ll pay interest on an amount that already includes interest \u2013 or she can sell the car and get very little out of the deal because of that massive amount still owing,\nOr,\u00a0as MFC puts it, she can \u201cpay the full balloon payment amount and take ownership of the vehicle\u201d.\nPressed to respond to the observation that the documentation does not highlight the massive final payment in any way, Browse said: \u201cThank you for the recommendation to make the line\u00a0regarding balloon payments more clear, especially where first-time buyers are concerned.\u00a0We have passed this on to our legal, compliance and \u2018Treat Customers Fairly\u2019 market conduct team to explore ways in this regard, taking into account all the other detail that generally\u00a0comes with a purchase of a vehicle.\u201d\nHe also undertook to \u201cfind a resolution in the matter of Ms Koloi\u201d.\u00a0\nA small glimmer of hope for her, one hopes.A lot can happen to a person\u2019s financial status in six years: they could no longer be eligible for a new loan, due to an impaired credit record; or the new finance deal could carry a much\u00a0higher interest rate.\nBut Rudolf Mahoney, Wesbank\u2019s head of brand and communications, says very few customers keep their cars for the full six years.\n\u201cThe average replacement cycle is 44 months \u2013 that\u2019s when the average motorist wants a new car.\u201d\nWith break-even point (when the consumer no longer owes the bank more than the car is worth) being only at around month 54 or 55, that creates challenges for the dealership, Mahoney\u00a0says.\n\u201cThe consumer who decides they want a new car in month 44 needs to pay the remaining instalments and the dealer is under pressure to come up with some kind of trade-in assistance to\u00a0get the deal.\u201d CONTACT WENDY E-mail: consumer@knowler.co.za Twitter: @wendyknowler#SHELFIEBUTTER SPLUTTER\u00a0\nThe butter price story, in two images. The first one, of a 500g brick of Shoprite\u2019s private label Crystal Valley butter, comprising 100% cream, was taken in May 2013. Fast forward five years and 500g of Crystal\u00a0Valley Easy-Spread Modified Butter (with rapeseed oil and less than 50% butterfat) is selling for more than double the price.",

  "plain_text": "Yoga class starts shortly, the pristine massage centre is open for business and cheesecake is served on a platter of pastries and fruit.\nAnd then the muffled cry of a baby emerges down the hallway.\nThe setting may resemble a five-star hotel, but this is a \u201csitting centre\u201d on Shanghai\u2019s outskirts where mothers pay up to 70,000 yuan ($11,000) a month to stay with their newborns.\nChinese culture dictates that mothers confine themselves after giving birth, also known as a \u201csitting month\u201d. Such confinement was once widely practised in many areas of the world and continues to be popular in other parts of Asia.\nBut as incomes rise in China, the sitting month no longer means being cooped up at home without bathing or visitors.\n\u201cWe prefer to find a professional facility to take care of our baby. We have no experience in taking care of the baby or ourselves after birth,\u201d said Yu Xueting, 34, a first-time mother, her weeks-old son \u201cKangkang\u201d lying contentedly beside her.Both appear well looked-after at the private Lake Malaren International Postpartum Care Centre in a modern building embellished with turrets and intended to mimic old northern European architecture.\nMother and son are accompanied at all times by a nanny who sleeps in the same room. Numerous specialists, nurses and cooks are on hand.\nA photography studio captures those precious early days of life, while a \u201cmother\u2019s classroom\u201d runs lectures for new moms to learn how to care for their baby \u2014 and themselves.\nDads can stay too, but usually just visit.\nYu, who works for IT firm Hewlett-Packard, said the lengthy stay \u201cliberates our family\u201d.\n\u201cIf we do it at home (take care of the baby), then the whole family can\u2019t sleep well. I can take maternity leave, but my husband needs to go to work.\u201d\n\u201cSitting month\u201c, or \u201cZuoyuezi\u201d, stretches back to about 200BC and the Han Dynasty, said Elizabeth Hui-Choi, a lecturer at Hong Kong University\u2019s School of Nursing.\nEmpresses would be well looked after following childbirth, including a special diet and lifestyle to restore their \u201cbroken\u201d body and prevent future illness, said Hui-Choi.\n\u201cThey believed that treating the mother well would also bring good things to the baby, and it is still believed to be that way.\u201d\nTraditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) \u201calso plays a very important part\u201d in how most Chinese women still think after childbirth, dictating they should eat more of certain foods, such as ginger, and cut out others such as fruit, she said.\nSome stop showering, washing their hair, or even brushing their teeth for the month, and won\u2019t venture outside \u2014 TCM says these can upset the body\u2019s balance.\nYu did not wash her hair for a week, but doctors told her that was unnecessary and the centre recommends a more scientific approach that blends TCM and Western medicine.\nHui-Choi, a registered midwife trained in Western medicine, said some of the old rituals are unhygienic and that studies suggest strict observance of tradition can make women feel isolated, risking post-partum depression.\nAccording to the Legal Daily, a state newspaper, the number of sitting centres in China has \u201cexploded\u201d from dozens in 2000 to more than 4,000 in 2017.\nOne reason is that Chinese today are now giving birth later in life \u2014 meaning grandparents are older and may not be able to help as much.\nAnd Chinese are increasingly able to afford places like the Shanghai centre, where staff fuss over every baby sniffle.\nDemand has also ramped up since China began phasing out its one-child policy in 2015. Families can be too stretched with their first child to cope with a second, especially if there is no extended family to help out.Sitting centres or self-proclaimed experts in \u201cZuoyuezi\u201d are found almost anywhere that ethnic Chinese are found, including in North America, making it a big business with global reach. However in Britain, doctors recently warned about the dangers of Chinese mothers locking themselves away after childbirth, fearing post-natal depression may go unnoticed or mums may avoid seeing a doctor for physical problems.\nXu Jingfang, baby son Kirk gurgling away beside her, said her British husband was initially sceptical.\n\u201cAt first he thought it was a weird idea. He said: \u2018You\u2019re having a baby, not heart surgery,\u2019\u201d said the 30-year-old Xu, one of about 80 other mums at the Shanghai establishment.\nXu scouted similar centres including one in a high-end hotel, saying \u201call our friends and relatives\u201d now opt for such care.\n\u201cIt\u2019s much easier. Here, you\u2019ve got 24-hour care for the baby and someone to cook for you six meals a day,\u201d added Xu, a phalanx of carers on hand to whisk away Kirk at the first hint of a whimper.\nXu said that while her parents and grandparents did not wash for weeks after birth, they accept that times have changed.\nSo will it be a shock to finally go home?\n\u201cI\u2019ve hired a nanny at home. I guess life will be more interesting than here \u2014 sometimes I do get a bit bored \u2014 but also tougher.\u201d",

  "plain_text": "Every so often South Africa breaks your heart. Sometimes this beautiful country fills your heart to bursting point with hope and inspiration, then the next moment it \u2013 and its politicians in particular \u2013 will drive you to the point of despair.\nOn Saturday, Siya Kolisi and his Springboks came back from 20 points down to an exhilarating, unbelievable victory that made fans of the national team believe in it again. For a few moments, a country that has descended into mainly destructive social-media racial warfare was reminded that we are all human, all South African. For a moment, hope beat hard in our hearts.\nFor a moment we united behind a bunch of young people representing our nation, forgetting that it was just a few days before that Floyd Shivambu, a leader of the EFF and member of parliament, had insulted the minister of Finance, the director-general of the National Treasury and other officials by saying that they were cowed by, specifically, a South African of Indian origin. His racism was palpable as his party started circulating propaganda about \u201cIndian influence\u201d in the ANC. Idi Amin, where are you?Despair settles in one\u2019s heart at the utterances and actions of politicians such as Shivambu.\nMeanwhile, the economy contracted 2.2% compared with the prior three months. The rand, together with other emerging-market currencies, took a beating last week. Jobs are and will be lost, food prices will continue to increase while the cost of living will be higher all round. This is what the delegates to the ANC\u2019s KwaZulu-Natal provincial conference on Friday should have been obsessing about.\nInstead, they prevented their own leader, national chairperson Gwede Mantashe, from taking to the podium to address them. They sang their favourite ditty at him: \u201cTell us what (Jacob) Zuma has done!\u201d\nThe conference collapsed. The party\u2019s provincial leaders \u2013 themselves illegitimately elected two years ago and their structure nullified by the courts \u2013 are now hoping to mount another conference in the next few weeks. Don\u2019t hold your breath for success of that meeting, either, as they have been implicated in the collapse of this past weekend\u2019s conference. This is leadership? One despairs.And yet at the same time it was such a joy to see South Africa represented by Cyril Ramaphosa at the meeting of world leaders in Canada this past weekend. With all his shortcomings and lack of support from within his own party, Ramaphosa is the sort of president one wants to see representing our nation rather than the sordid, incoherent, scandal-soaked mess who has soiled our leadership on the world stage over the past 10 years. From the United Nations to the African Union, Zuma destroyed whatever credibility South Africa had. He was a joke wherever he went. He made one despair.\nZuma was in court again on Friday, claiming that those who spoke against him must not \u201cprovoke\u201d him or he will fight back. The man can say this because for 10 years the ANC allowed him to destroy the Scorpions, the National Prosecuting Authority, the intelligence services, the SA Revenue Service and other key state institutions, and remake them into his own tools. Of course, he has \u201cthe dirty goods\u201d on all his comrades: they kept quiet as he used the intelligence services to spy on them and the rest of civil society.\nMeanwhile, in municipalities across North West, residents have no water, no electricity and no sewage disposal. The Sunday Times reported that the mayor of Koster constructed a road to her business rather than to the local health facility. Idi Amin again, anyone? The man who destroyed North West, Supra Mahumapelo, stood by Zuma on Friday and sang his praises. Mahumapelo should be in jail, but no, he is in North West helping Zuma foment dissent against Ramaphosa.Where is the opposition?\nShivambu is playing dirty race politics while the Democratic Alliance\u2019s leaders are fighting over their shrinking cake when they could be sitting on a much bigger cake after next year\u2019s elections.\nThankfully, Jacob Zuma taught us that our future is in our own hands. Over the past 10 years civil society has become more organised, more vocal, more prepared to stand up against the cant and corruption of state players. South Africa will sail through its myriad challenges not because of its so-called leaders, but because of its people. What ordinary people achieved over the past 10 years, against state capture and rampant corruption, is testament to the fact that our future is in our hands, and not of the politicians.",

  "plain_text": "Throughout history, people have been starting sentences with the phrase \u201cthroughout history\u201d without stopping to think what a ridiculous, empty and meaningless clich\u00e9 it is.\nFellow word nerds will probably point out that clich\u00e9s are by definition ridiculous, empty and meaningless, but I felt the need to add emphasis.\nWhen someone says \u201cthroughout history\u201d, what they are really referring to is the particular time in a particular place during which a particular group of people have been doing a particular thing.\nThat\u2019s not \u201cthroughout history\u201d. It might be \u201cthroughout the history of the Fifa World Cup\u201d perhaps, or \u201csince cats took over the Internet\u201d, but no one can ever claim that something has been happening since the beginning of time (another clich\u00e9) because no one was around then, so who\u2019s to say what kind of soccer those prehistoric cats were playing?\nGetting back to recent history, a lot of people have been saying: \u201cThroughout history, people have been arguing about history.\u201dThat is blatant nonsense. What they mean is: \u201cEver since people have been telling stories about what may or may not have happened to them and to those who went before them, there have been arguments about whose version of events is the most believable and the most important.\u201d\nThat sentence takes up more space but you have to admit it\u2019s more accurate. It doesn\u2019t solve the what-history-to-teach debate, unfortunately, but putting history in its place might calm the opponents down a bit.\nHistory is a funny old word. It comes from the ancient Greek histor, meaning a judge or a wise man, which morphed into historia, which variously meant: to make inquiries; to give an account in response to an inquiry; and keeping a record of stuff by telling people about it.\nThat is pretty much what we still understand today by \u201chistory\u201d, but neither language nor history ever travels in a straight line.\nBefore it became an English word, history wandered off the field for a refreshment break and became histoire. In France in the 12th century, this term applied equally to true and false versions of events.\nPerhaps the French acceptance that fact and fiction were equally qualified to wear the label \u201chistory\u201d is the most accurate definition there has been of this word.When the English first embraced history (the Online Etymology Dictionary tells us that the word came into common use sometime in the 14th century), they too accepted that truth was not a prerequisite for a narratiive of events.\nSo in its early form, history was just \u201cstory\u201d with \u201chi\u201d in the front. Only in the late 15th century did it become associated with a set of recorded events presumed to be true, and thence a subject taught in schools.\nThis is where all the trouble started. From the youthful, matey \u201cHi, Story\u201d, history grew up into a stuffy old uncle who claimed to be the arbiter of objective truth. And that, as we all know, is impossible.\nFor all the reasons stated above, we can\u2019t say: \u201cThroughout history people have argued about history.\u201d We can, however, say: \u201cEver since history mistakenly came to be seen as an infallible account of what really happened, people have argued about it.\u201dEven when it is accepted that any retelling of the past is shaped by the views and objectives of whoever is doing the telling, the argument still rages over what parts of history deserve to be given precedence in, for instance, a school syllabus.\nHistory does not relate whether a sound measure of historical significance has ever been agreed upon in any country in the world at any time in the history of arguments about history, but then history would not be able to relate such a thing even if it had happened, because history does not relate anything. People relate history.\nI do not envy those who have to make decisions about the history curriculum that will be most beneficial to pupils. But I really do hope that the phrase \u201cthroughout history\u201d is entirely banned from all history books.",

  "plain_text": "Here is one difference between Donald Trump and the EFF: when Donald Trump launches a distracting manoeuvre designed to appeal to the limbic system, the libidinously unthinking lower emotions of what is properly and accurately called his base, he does it in a chaotic, ad hoc manner, without co-ordination and usually to the dismay of his team, who have to scramble to make sense of it. When the EFF do it, it is never unco-ordinated; they have a war council first and plan it out. Because Trump is a man of no principle, he sometimes casually and without embarrassment reverses what he said. Because the EFF are so much more rigorously and committedly without principle than Donald Trump is, they never reverse what they say.\nThis week in parliament\u2019s finance committee meeting Floyd Shivambu \u2013 the same Floyd who called journalist Carien du Plessis a white bitch, and then \u201capologised\u201d for acting in a way that was unprofessional (presumably because professionals know when to air their race-inflected misogyny, and when to keep it for use with friends and colleagues), and then enthusiastically affirmed that he only apologised because it was a non-issue that was taking up his otherwise valuable time, like a child who is forced by a teacher to say sorry to the boy he bullied and then afterwards whispers to the boy \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it\u201d \u2013 that Floyd Shivambu objected to the repeated presence in committee meetings of Treasury deputy director general Ismail Momoniat because he is not African.He went on to enrich this objection with the claim that Momoniat is a racist who can\u2019t work with black leaders, that historically he was part of a sinister cabal of Indians within the liberation movement sowing discord and duplicitously undermining the black leadership. Those sneaky Indians, said Floyd Shivambu, somehow managing not to use those words precisely: they\u2019re racist and you can\u2019t trust them.\nOf course the earnest and concerned members of what remains of the responsible national media rose to counter his claims by citing Momoniat\u2019s struggle credentials\u00a0\u2013 his attested history of being one of the good Indians. Lucky for Ismail Momoniat that it\u2019s okay to attack someone based on their race, provided they have a good enough struggle CV, and provided enough people with good CVs have dealt with them personally. Good luck to your kids and grandkids though, Ismail.\nStrategic-minded commentators have pointed out that Shivambu\u2019s move against Momoniat, endorsed and doubled-down by the upper structures of the party, complete with willfully miscontextualised internal document from 1990 plucked from the O\u2019Malley Archives, was probably motivated as much by bad history and crude malice as it was a politically targeted attempt to remove Momoniat, a resolute and implacable stumbling block to their support for VBS Bank. That\u2019s almost certainly true, but it\u2019s still not the point.\nThe point I would like to make is that the EFF is normalising a toxic, cynical exclusionary nationalism that in its fundamentals is barely different to that of, say, Donald Trump.\nDo you think I\u2019m a white person complaining because the EFF don\u2019t like white people? I\u2019m not. Well, I am, but that\u2019s not the real thrust of it. Disliking whites is the uncontroversial face of the EFF\u2019s exclusionary nationalism. It\u2019s the easy sell, especially to broadly well-meaning, aspirationally progressive whites, the ones acutely aware of their history, a group to which I suppose I largely belong. No, exclusionary nationalism speaks loudest and most confidently about whites, but its eyes are everywhere.\nBy their toxic ideology, which is every day further normalised when their critics don\u2019t challenge the tenets of that ideology but rather rebut the specifics of their individual slurs and smears, the EFF gets to decide who is South African enough.\nIndians and coloureds are not South African enough for the EFF. Remember when the EFF questioned where Malusi Gigaba was born? Remember when Julius Malema said Duduzane and Duduzile Zuma were not properly South African because they\u2019d been born in exile in Mozambique? Citizens born in Zimbabwe or Mozambique are not South African enough for the EFF. Are you black and South African and don\u2019t agree with the EFF? You are not black South African enough for the EFF.\nMy friend Claire tells me \u2013 and I agree \u2013 that South Africans are an inherently moderate people. We are resistant to the extremes, we choose a middle way, and that may explain why the EFF\u2019s actual support is still so derisively small. If the EFF and Afriforum were accorded media attention in proportion to their actual support, we would barely hear another peep from either of them. But the EFF are attempting to breathe life into a vicious populist ideology that they may themselves never ride to power but which doesn\u2019t need them. It can burn and burn long after we\u2019re all gone.",

  "plain_text": "Some people think that former president Jacob Zuma is a liar.\nHe lied, they will claim, from his very first moments in office, when he vowed to uphold the constitution and defend South Africa\u2019s laws.\nEven at the end, they will insist, he was lying; telling the country he still didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d done wrong; playing the role of a bemused grandfather unfairly ganged up on by an ungrateful family.\nI can see why they\u2019d believe he was lying all along. These days, however, I\u2019m not sure they\u2019re right.\nIt comes down to our definition of a lie, which is, we all agree, to make an intentionally false statement. The liar knows the truth but chooses to present a distorted or entirely fabricated version of it.\nBut what happens if the \u201cliar\u201d is living in a reality where his lies are accepted truths? Is he a liar just because our version of reality differs from his? Is the problem with him, or is it with us?In some instances we are happy to be flexible. Nobody, for example, would accuse a schizophrenic or psychotic person of telling lies when he or she describes things that have not happened in our reality.\nI\u2019m not suggesting that Zuma is mentally ill. But I am starting to believe that he inhabits a political, social and ethical reality is that utterly unrecognisable to you or me.\nI don\u2019t mean that in a snarky rhetorical way. I\u2019m not using the metaphor of alternative realities to make a comment about how out of touch the ruling class is or how warped the Zuptas\u2019\u00a0morality has become. What I\u2019m wondering is much more literal and practical, namely: what if Jacob Zuma simply doesn\u2019t see the same constraints you and I see? What if, in his mind, right is what feels good and wrong is what doesn\u2019t? Literally.\nConsider his astonishing remarks to a Cosas rent-a-crowd on Wednesday.\nThe man who put Blade Nzimande in charge of higher education claimed that free education should have happened 10 years ago. The man who mocked \u201cclever blacks\u201d said that education is the route to empowerment. The man who helped hollow out the economy and drive it towards junk status said that South Africa needed job creators rather than job seekers.(There were other astonishing titbits, like his pride at making sure that the matric pass rate only ever goes up. I\u2019ve been satirising the Education Department\u2019s steam-powered \u201cPass-O-Matic\u201d mark-raising machine for years, but I never expected a former president to publically endorse it as a good idea.)\nHis criticisms of education and the economy were staggeringly hypocritical. Almost everything that came out of his mouth was absurd. But they were only hypocritical and absurd if you live in a reality where there is cause and effect, action and consequence; where gravity pushes you down and venality is a vice rather than a virtue. And I don\u2019t think Zuma lives in this reality.\nWhich is why I don\u2019t think he is a liar. I think he believes most of what he says, most of the time, and, more startlingly, that it is mostly true for the universe he inhabits. On Planet Zuma, populated and kept spinning by a few hundred thousand believers, he was a good president. He was prevented from creating a utopia by a cabal of White Monopoly Capitalists and treacherous sell-outs in the ANC. He was betrayed. He is a victim. He did nothing wrong.\nAnd so, when Zuma pops up again in a week or two to explain that State Capture is a lie and that if he were still president we\u2019d all be bathing in chocolate, I will listen, amazed, the way one might listen to static from a distant star. And instead of getting angry or outraged, I\u2019ll simply marvel and ask myself: what must it be like to live on Jacob Zuma\u2019s planet?",

  "plain_text": "Ms Baartman teaches a Grade 11 history class on early slavery in the Cape. After taking her class on trip to the Iziko Slave Lodge the pupils are taught skills for analysing original manuscripts, which they have in hand, depicting the lives of slaves in the colony. They not only learn about the political economy of slavery in the 17th century (big picture) but also the connection to ordinary slave lives within that system (the many small pictures). In small groups the pupils identify the different classes of slaves, including free and baptised slaves, and what social and economic purposes were served by such division. Later the pupils are shown the movie Krotoa and are required to write a critical essay on how slave lives are depicted in this movie. For the end of the semester, the pupils are taught and required to use slave records to trace through names (like April and February) the history of one slave family over time. The unit concludes with a discussion on modern-day slavery and the continuities with slavery in the past.\nMinister Angie Motshekga was understandably defensive in launching the Report of the History Ministerial Task Team Report at the end of May. The plan to make history compulsory in senior high school was not ruling party propaganda, she insisted, before anyone even asked. It was not political expediency, she continued. This effort was \u201cin no way an attempt to rewrite history for the ruling elites\u201d. If you believe such nonsense you deserve to have compulsory history shoved down your throat. This is pure, propagandistic, ruling-party nonsense.\nForget inclusivity, let alone truth, in content or symbolism. The large photograph on the front cover of the Ministerial Task Team Report betrays the official lie that this process will \u201cguide us towards a History that includes all of us\u201d. That cover photo projects a picture of black African youth in traditional clothing doing a traditional dance. It\u2019s about Angie\u2019s people not about Indian, coloured, white South Africans. Black nationalists are no different from white nationalists\u2014their goal is to impress their version of history on the people in the same way that they will not rest until every major airport is named after an African nationalist. The white nationalists named Cape Town airport after the scoundrel DF Malan; the black nationalists will almost surely rename it after one of the Mandelas. To hell with the rest of the population: this is their time.\nForget a nuanced account of history that includes critical stories about atrocities committed by liberation movements in the otherwise noble quest for freedom. No, the enemy comes in one form, as the minister let slip in a grammatically clumsy paragraph that was intended to make the counter-point: \u201cThe apartheid rulers will henceforth be presented as folk devils.\u201d If Angie Motshekga is to be believed, that this attempt to make history compulsory throughout school is not propaganda, then South Africa will be the first country on the planet not to use historical narratiives to shore up the regime in power.Why compulsory history now and not in 1994? Quite simple. The idea of forcing every senior pupil to do history first emerged in 2012 when the government was under duress. Then President Jacob Zuma was in full sway raiding the state. The police had just killed 34 miners at Marikana and seriously injured 78 more. The 2012 World Report on South Africa lamented corruption, growing social and economic inequalities, and partisan appointments at every level of government. And a third of South Africans were unemployed in that year even as reports came in of a school system in rapid decline. This was the ideal time to inculcate into the minds of innocent youth what the minister at the history launch called \u201cvalues, attitudes and behaviours that contribution to nation-building \u2026\u201d In other words, to breed patriotic followers not critical citizens. Which is also a good time to remember Samuel Johnson\u2019s quip, that patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.\nAt least the Rwandan government was honest. It completely obliterated the teaching of history in schools. Their notion of \u201ca usable past\u201d, as historians call it, was to pretend there was no past. Why dredge up for learning the horrific genocide of the Tutsis at the hands of Hutus? South Africans will not be spared this last trick of Angie Motshekga\u2019s reign as minister.\nIn the end, the practical problems of teaching history like Ms Baartman will collapse the system. Roughly 6,484 history teachers graduate each year \u2014 there are more than 26,000 schools \u2014 and more than half of those are from Unisa which means they have not had the rigour of face-to-face teaching and supervision. The notion that critical teachers can be \u201ctrained\u201d to teach like Ms Baartman, even with much more money and obliging schools of education from our universities, is to deny the current malaise in the education system and the repeated evidence from studies that show our model of teacher-training is not working.\nWhat the minister should be doing is ensuring every school pupil can read and do mathematics. That every preschool child has access to quality education. And that the 500,000 youth who drop out in the school cycle between grades 2 and 12 are kept in school. Either that, or we\u2019re all history.",

              "text": "Ms Baartman teaches a Grade 11 history class on early slavery in the Cape. After taking her class on trip to the Iziko Slave Lodge the pupils are taught skills for analysing original manuscripts, which they have in hand, depicting the lives of slaves in the colony. They not only learn about the political economy of slavery in the 17th century (big picture) but also the connection to ordinary slave lives within that system (the many small pictures). In small groups the pupils identify the different classes of slaves, including free and baptised slaves, and what social and economic purposes were served by such division.

  "plain_text": "Ousmann Umar may seem like a role model to fellow migrants, having built a successful new life in Europe after making the dangerous journey from Africa. And yet his sole message to peers today is \u201cdon\u2019t do it\u201d.\nThe Ghanaian in his 30s has just completed a master\u2019s degree, after surviving a five-year trek across his home continent followed by a perilous boat crossing to Spain. But he\u2019s also actively pursuing a campaign to discourage others from following in his footsteps.\n\u201cI went from being almost illiterate to studying a master\u2019s; it\u2019s like I won the lottery,\u201d Umar, dressed in a blazer, white shirt and moccasins, said in the seaside town of Badalona near Barcelona.\u00a0 But \u201ctoday I wouldn\u2019t do it again, it\u2019s too hard\u201d, he said as he gazed at the Mediterranean Sea, where thousands of migrants have died trying to reach Europe.\n\u201cI am only 0.01%. (Many others) die along the way and of those who arrive, only 1% manage to integrate into European life.\u201dHaving already founded an NGO promoting childhood education in Ghana, Umar recently launched a project with migrant rescue charity Proactiva Open Arms that aims to convince his compatriots to stay at home.\nOver the past three years the group says it has rescued nearly 60,000 migrants from the Mediterranean.\nUmar recalls the ordeal of crossing the Sahara desert without water, the mistreatment he suffered in Libya and Algeria, and the death of his best friend along the journey to Europe.\n\u201cI will always carry this burden. That is why I don\u2019t want anyone to go through what I did,\u201d he said.\nUmar said death has played a key part in his life since he was born in Fiaso, a tiny village in Ghana\u2019s rainforest. His mother died while giving birth to him, which in Ghanaian culture means that the child is \u201ccursed\u201d and must be killed.He escaped this fate thanks to his father being the local witchdoctor. But when he was nine years old, Umar was sent to live with a distant uncle who taught him to be a welder.\nHe eventually decided to go to Europe when he was about 13. The search for a better life quickly turned into a nightmare when the human traffickers abandoned him with 45 others in the middle of the Sahara desert.\nUmar said he walked for 21 days, surviving by drinking his own urine while many of his companions died along the way. By the time they reached Libya there were only six of them left.\u201cThe biggest grave is not the sea, it is the desert,\u201d Umar said.After working in Libya for several years, he made it to Mauritania where he boarded a boat packed with migrants bound for the \u201cpromised land\u201d \u2013 Spain\u2019s Canary Islands.\u00a0 Along the way he lost his best friend Musa, whose boat sank during the crossing.\n\u201cI vowed I would never return to the water. It was total anguish. I don\u2019t know how to swim and I thought I could die at any moment,\u201d Umar recalled.\nAfter a short stint at a migrant reception centre on Fuerteventura, he was sent to Barcelona where he had dreamed of living ever since he watched the Barcelona football\u00a0 team on TV as a child.\nHe slept rough for a month before a couple with three children took him into their home.\n\u201cI was born again that day,\u201d he said 13 years later.Umar learnt to speak Spanish and Catalan, completed high school and last week finished a master\u2019s degree in international co-operation at Barcelona\u2019s prestigious ESADE business school.\nDuring this time he made a living repairing bicycles, earning enough to pay for his studies as well as those of his brother who is still in Ghana and runs Umar\u2019s Nasco education charity there.\nFounded in 2012, Nasco acquires computer equipment and provides training in new technologies at five rural schools in Ghana to provide opportunities so youngsters do not need to immigrate.\nThe plan is to send migrants rescued in the Mediterranean by Proactiva Open Arms to give talks at the Nasco-backed schools in Ghana about the ordeal they faced trying to get to Europe.\n\u201cWe want to explain to them before they leave what they can expect during this long journey, from people from their country whom we rescued,\u201d said Proactiva founder Oscar Camps.\n\u201cOusmann says he won the lottery. But in the lottery, if you don\u2019t win, everything remains the same. This is more like Russian roulette,\u201d he added.",

  "plain_text": "Writing about the super-rich in South Africa is hardly the formula to win plaudits from the politically correct or the army of virtue-signalling trolls who inhabit the Twittersphere and blogosphere which is laughingly mislabelled \u201csocial media\u201d. Antisocial media, given the outpourings of bile and hate often spewed on these platforms, might be a more accurate label.\nHowever, Ruchir Sharma \u2013 author of the excellent study The Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World \u2013 hardly fears the denizens of democratic outrage. Perhaps his day job as global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management inoculates him from such concern; but his expertise and research is more focused on developing than mature markets.\nThis past weekend, in the pages of the New York Times, Sharma penned an interesting article headlined: \u201cThe Millionaires are Fleeing. Maybe You Should, Too\u201d.\nHe notes: \u201cWhen a country begins to fall into economic and political difficulty, wealthy people are often the first to ship their money to safer havens abroad. The rich don\u2019t always emigrate along with their money, but when they do, it is an even more telling sign of trouble.\u201dOf some interest, the article is based on research by a Johannesburg-headquartered company, New World Wealth, which these past six years has been tracking \u201cmillionaire migrations\u201d and some 100,000 out of 15 million global US dollar millionaires changed their country of residence in the past year.\nThe current report, he notes, awarded the top place to Turkey as a country from which the super-rich have fled, followed closely by failed state Venezuela. Some 12% of Turkey\u2019s millionaires left the country and, as Sharmir notes, \u201cAs if on cue, the Turkish lira is now in freefall.\u201d  The report did not cite the figures for South Africa. But a 2016 survey by the same outfit noted that in 2015 South Africa lost 950 millionaires to emigration \u2013 and given the annus horribilis of the final year of Jacob Zuma\u2019s misrule and our cratering currency, 2017 was probably even worse.\nPortugal, which in exchange for \u20ac500,000 property investment there offers its so-called \u201cgolden visa\u201d applicants rights of residency, now records that just behind Brazilians, South Africans constitute the second highest number of applicants.\nThe head of research at New World Wealth, Andrew Amoils, said the previous decline in numbers was mainly due to \u201cpoor economic conditions\u201d, followed by \u201cthe inability (presumably of leavers) to deal with changing social dynamics\u201d; \u201cconcerns over their children\u2019s future\u201d; crime; and BEE requirements etc.So much for the factors pushing the rich out. What brings them in or attracts wealth creators? According to the survey by New World Wealth, topping the list are: \u201cstrong ownership rights\u201d; \u201cstrong economic growth\u201d; a well-developed banking system; \u201cfree and independent media\u201d; \u201clow levels of government intervention and taxation\u201d; and \u201cease of investment\u201d.\nOther than the boisterous media space here, it is easy to see how we have slid ever further down the totem pole of attractive places to be for the well-heeled, the very demographic who have the ease of mobility not given so easily to less wealthy citizens. Since the report, further tax hikes have been given to the top bracket of payers, the debate on expropriation without compensation has been cranked up to fever pitch, and government intervention has increased. And in the same period the growth percentage has been outpaced by population increase. Of course the arrival of Cyril Rampahosa has changed the negative optics somewhat. But as a mergers and acquisition lawyer at Norton Rose Fulbright, Kevin Kron, told the Sunday Times, \u201cinvestor interest is still quite cautious\u201d.\u00a0\nBeyond the movement of multimillionaires and the moolah, we have the data published by the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation. South Africa\u2019s ranking for \u201cease of doing business\u201d has dropped from a respectable 28th position out of 178 countries surveyed in 2006 to a lowly 74th out of 190 countries on the 2017 list.Hot on its heels were the remarks of Investec\u2019s global head of private banking, Ciaran Whelan. His clients are disproportionately from the ranks of the super-wealthy. He told a video conference why some of the bank\u2019s clients view SA as high risk: \u201cSouth Africa is deemed to be a high risk jurisdiction in terms of the compliance, and the amount of paperwork and the number of questions you have to answer is extremely high.\u201d\nNo doubt a lot of the local chattering class will say \u201cgood riddance\u201d. But then there is the news from Eskom which spotlights the truth of many in the current millionaire class. The number of people on the public sector payroll\u00a0 has expanded massively over recent decades from 1.45 million in 1993 to 2.04 million last year (at a cost of R387-billion to taxpayers each year), according to John Kane-Berman of the Institute of Race Relations. And there is no shortage of millionaires at the top end of state-owned companies, where salaries outpace the private sector by around 30%. Yet, in the case of tottering Eskom, its chairperson recently revealed that it was around one third overstaffed, and its total workforce had increased a whopping 50% in just 10 years. But all the while its productivity has declined, its revenue stream has shrunk, and its outstanding debt now tops R3,867-billion, just a shade under 10% of the total economic produce in the country.But the millionaires who are moving out are not unproductive \u2013 they are the skilled, the entrepreneurs and often the wealth and job creators.\nThese days the most uncomfortable discussion \u2013around race and identity \u2013 actually requires no move out of the comfort zone, least of all for those who claim any slight or unsuccessful promotion is attributable to the unalterable condition of racial classification.\nBut a pressing matter is also keeping local millionaires at home. Otherwise how will the overextended fiscus preserve its tax base, disproportionately dependent on\u00a0 high-income earners?\n\u00a0With such high levels of inequality in SA and with only around 40,000 of them in the country, they are neither a matter for much sympathy and only collectively account for one seat in parliament, hardly a vote-winning constituency.\nBut as Ruchir Sharma observes: \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of them, but they can tell us a great deal about what is going wrong \u2013 and right \u2013 in a country\u2019s economic and political ecosystems. Leaders who create the right conditions to keep millionaires home will find that all of their residents \u2013 not just the wealthy ones \u2013 are richer for it.\u201d\nOne wonders whether a member of this elite, President Cyril Ramaphosa, has added this consideration to his inbox?",

  "plain_text": "This morning the price of petrol rose from Jesus Wept per litre to It Puts The Lotion On Its Skin per litre. To help cushion the blow, here is a list of handy cost-cutting methods to make your budget stretch a little further if you drive a car.\n\u2022 Accelerate smoothly. (Cape Town: \u201caccelerate\u201d is a thing you can do with your car if you use that pedal on the right. Johannesburg: \u201caccelerate\u201d is a thing you can do with your car if you have previously done another thing called \u201cbraking\u201d. Durban: this is a thing called \u201ca column\u201d. You\u2019re doing super well to have got so far. Hang in there.)\n\u2022 Don't drive in rush hour. This means you should not drive between 4am and 10.30am, 11am and 2.15pm, 2.17pm and 9.30pm.\n\u2022 Work for national government. Well, I say \u201cwork\u201d but you know what I mean. If you \u201cwork\u201d very \u201chard\u201d you will get a free car containing free petrol, thereby transforming your figurative free ride into a literal one.\n\u2022 Modify your car to run on liquid gold. It will work out cheaper in the long run.\u2022 Go to HR and explain to them that the petrol price is high because the oil price is high, and the oil price is high because of strong US economic growth, the threat of tighter sanctions on Iran, China flexing its muscles and the Machiavellian workings of the Opec cartel. In other words, you are the victim of an international conspiracy by shadowy despots who have made your car too expensive to drive. Explain to HR that they have two choices: either they get Sizwe and Charlene from Legal to sue the United States, China and Opec, or they allow you to work from home.\u2022 Use the cash you would spend in your average commuting week to buy and train a team of snow geese to hold the corners of a large blanket in their beaks. Then sit in the middle of the blanket and let your snow geese fly to you work like a homunculus in a Swedish fairy-tale.\n\u2022 Finally: design yourself a jumpsuit made out of highly adhesive toes of 45 million geckos. Position yourself near an upmarket school at about 7.15am, but obviously not in a creepy way, or in the least creepy way possible while wearing a suit made out of 45 million gecko toes. At about 7.30am the caravan of SUVs will arrive: bloated Porsche Cayennes and Range Rovers, each containing one enormous sense of entitlement and one tiny child. Once the child is offloaded, stick yourself to the rear window or roof of the car and allow it to take you closer to work. Repeat this process until you are there. Or in jail.\nGodspeed, South Africa. It\u2019s going to get stressful and bad-tempered out there, so let\u2019s try to remember what\u2019s important and do our best to protect the infinitely precious, irreplaceable cargo we carry in our cars: petrol.",

  "plain_text": "At an unlikely cat shelter in rebel-held northern Syria, Mohammed Alaa al-Jaleel gently holds a feline patient on her back as an ultrasound probe is rolled across her pregnant belly.\nIn a time of war, she is one of hundreds to have received medical attention at the makeshift animal clinic in Kafr Naha, an opposition-held town in Aleppo province.\n\u201cIf you want to show mercy to people, start by showing mercy to everything else,\u201d says Jaleel, who runs Ernesto\u2019s Cat Sanctuary, named after his favourite furry friend.\nThe 43-year-old, who grew up in Syria\u2019s second city Aleppo, has been mad about cats since he was a boy.\nAs a young adult in the city, he would drop by the butcher on his way home from work as an electrician to ask for scraps to feed street cats in his neighbourhood. When war broke out in 2011, he put down his tools to become an ambulance driver to help ferry the wounded \u2013 but never stopped bringing food to his feline friends.As the war raged on and cat lovers fled the city, Jaleel was left with 170 cats to feed and a new nickname: the Cat Man of Aleppo.\nWith the help of donations from friends and social media fans, he set up his first cat sanctuary in the city.\nBut in late 2016, the regime ramped up its deadly bombardment of Aleppo\u2019s opposition-held neighbourhoods as it sought to regain control of the whole city.\n\u201cWe started fleeing from neighbourhood to neighbourhood until, in the end, we escaped the city altogether,\u201d Jaleel recalls.Determined not to leave them behind, he and fellow feline fans managed to save 22 of the city\u2019s cats. \u201cWe gave each family two cats in a plastic vegetable basket,\u201d Jaleel says.\nAmong them was Sukhoi, named after the stealth fighter jets of regime ally Russia.\n\u201cHe would zip in and grab food from right under the noses of the other cats, just like a Sukhoi jet,\u201d he says.\nSyria\u2019s war has killed more than 350,000 people and displaced more than half its pre-war human population, as well as many of its domestic animals.\nAfter fleeing Aleppo, Jaleel set up his second shelter \u2013 named after Ernesto \u2013 in early 2017 and housed 18 of the 22 smuggled cats in the animal oasis.\u201cThe cats don\u2019t just stay in just one house. They swap with each other and sleep in all of them,\u201d Jaleel says, referring to rows of marble cubes with cat-sized entrances, engraved with names like Pouncer and Rose. Nearby, a grinder churns out streams of bright pink mincemeat that is scooped out onto plates spread out on the ground for lunchtime.\nEyes closed, a cat with a stripy, light ash coat dips its snow-white nose in, nibbling away.\nBut the shelter, financed by online crowdfunding campaigns, does more than provide twice-daily meals: it also serves as an animal clinic with its in-house vet.\n\u201cWe treat all sorts of animals here for free: horses, cows and even chickens,\u201d Jaleel says.During an inventory in January, he and his colleagues discovered they had handed out 7,000 medical prescriptions for free in less than a year.\nMohammad Watar was blown away when he brought in his cat for treatment after food poisoning.\u201cThere are no vets where I live. I asked people and they pointed me to the sanctuary,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI was so surprised to find this kind of thing existed during this war we\u2019re all living,\u201d says Watar.\n\u201cI saw them treating all sorts of animals. It\u2019s really beautiful.\u201d\nStill, war is never far away: the sanctuary\u2019s main building bears the marks of gunfire.\nLast month, it cancelled a children\u2019s party after a young boy was shot near the shelter, according to its English-language Facebook page.\nFootage posted online depicted a man in a cat sanctuary T-shirt carrying a child with blood streaming down his calf.Even the shelter\u2019s cats are treated for war wounds, says the centre\u2019s vet, Mohammed Yusuf. \u201cJust like many people are wounded by all the different weapons in the area, animals too suffer the same injuries,\u201d he says.\nSome stay under observation at his clinic for weeks, but not all of them get the treatment they need.\u201cWe\u2019re living in a war and facing severe shortages of veterinary medicines for wounds as well as vaccines,\u201d Yusuf says.\nIn a time of death and destruction, the pride of the sanctuary is its ability to carry out sonograms of animal mothers-to-be.\n\u201cWe examine them and diagnose how many foetuses there are and when they are due, and we prepare to welcome the new births,\u201d Yusuf says.\n\u2013 AFP",

  "plain_text": "On Sunday evening, Jeff Radebe told eNCA that there is no deal with Russia to build nuclear power stations in South Africa. I imagine that moments later, wild celebrations broke out all over the Kremlin, with Vladimir Putin sending a case of caviar to the head office of Rosatom with a handwritten note wishing staff a safe flight to Waterkloof.\nAfter all, this is the same Jeff Radebe who told us that the Seriti Commission wasn\u2019t a whitewash of the Arms Deal. The same Jeff Radebe who explained that the renovations at Nkandla were totes legit. The same Jeff Radebe who told Jacob Zuma it was a great idea to make Menzi Simelane the head of the National Prosecuting Authority \u2013 an appointment described by the Supreme Court of Appeal as \u201cirrational\u201d and \u201cunconstitutional\u201d.\nYes, Jeff has a said a lot of things over the years, like in 2014 when he told us that Zuma would complete his second term as president, or like in 2015 when he stood up to defend the Gangster-in-Chief against a vote of no confidence, citing the R1-trillion the Zuma administration had spent on infrastructure. OK, yes, quite a lot of that was spent on firepools and Gupta trains that didn\u2019t fit on our rails and dairy farms in the Free State and keeping the Saxonwold armoured personal carrier oiled, but it\u2019s all infrastructure, right?\nAt the end of his passionate defence \u2013 few politicians have sung as sweetly for their supper as our Jeff \u2013 he told the opposition to calm down about the prospect of removing Zuma.\n\u201cAt the end of this debate, after much noise from the opposition, as sure as the sun will rise from the east, President Zuma will be the president,\u201d he said.\nSince that day I\u2019ve double-checked every morning to make sure that the sun has, in fact, risen in the east. Because when Jeff says it\u2019s a sure thing, you know it\u2019s not. Not even close.Hence the likely celebrations in Moscow: now that Jeff has told us there is no deal with Russia, you\u2019d be forgiven for believing as gospel that there is a deal with Russia, or will be in the near future, or at least the bits of a deal that will still see important people get paid.\nThis isn\u2019t pure paranoid speculation. It\u2019s no secret that this government remains keen on nuclear power. In Sunday\u2019s interview, Jeff almost glowed in the dark with enthusiasm as he outlined his dream of South Africa supplying nuclear medicine to the rest of Africa. (Nuclear medicine, is, of course, radiation and so on, not the radioactive suppositories Putin makes you insert when you renege on your deals with him.) It seems fair to suggest that, at some stage in the future, South Africa will hire somebody to build us another nuclear power station. Which country\u2019s nuclear industry is most likely to win the tender? Well, that is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma \u2026\nThe bottom line, however, is that we just don\u2019t know. And how can we, when we are led by a government that seems pathologically unable to tell the truth?\nThis isn\u2019t unique to South Africa, of course. To become a successful politician you need intelligence, fantastically thick skin and a predator\u2019s instinct for identifying weakness. But to survive as a successful politician you need something more: the ability to compromise on literally anything. You must be able to swing with the prevailing electoral breeze, unencumbered by baggage like non-negotiable beliefs.\nIt\u2019s how Julius Malema was happy to become a colleague of Marthinus van Schalkwyk, the last leader of apartheid\u2019s ruling party. (In 2014, Malema told parliament that the sight of Kortbroek on the ANC benches had helped galvanise him into forming the EFF, but oddly enough it didn\u2019t seem to weaken his resolve to become ANC Youth League president first.)\nIt\u2019s how the DA could actively court the white supremacists left politically homeless by the end of Van Schalkwyk\u2019s NNP (the DA would offer independent opposition, wrote Helen Zille in 2005, \u201cand we invite all former NNP voters to join us in this endeavour\u201d) but, a few years later, claim the legacy of Nelson Mandela as its own.\nAnd it\u2019s how Jeff Radebe is still in government, telling us that the deal that wasn\u2019t on is now off, until it\u2019s on again.Like most South Africans, I don\u2019t have the information required to tell politicians\u2019 barefaced lies from mere fibs or mild manipulations. Like most South Africans, I no longer have the energy to try.\nWhich is why, these days, I\u2019m sticking to a basic rule of thumb. It\u2019s crude, but I think it works.\nIt is, simply, this: if you have ever publically defended Jacob Zuma or his enablers, or tried to ally yourself with white supremacists, and you are currently in parliament, and your mouth is moving, I\u2019m going to assume that you are lying.\nMore importantly, I\u2019m going to assume that you do not have the best interests of this country at heart. I don\u2019t know whose interests you are serving. It doesn\u2019t really matter. All I know is, I trust you about as much as a Jeff Radebe denial, a Julius Malema vow about who he will or won\u2019t work with, or a Mmusi Maimane opinion on leadership.\nOh, and just in case: congrats to the Comrades over at Rosatom. Don\u2019t spend it all in one place.",

  "plain_text": "Donald Trump tells lies, but because it\u2019s a bit awkward to say that of your president, some White House reporters have taken to calling his lies \u201cdemonstrable falsehoods\u201d.\u00a0\nHillary Clinton made the word \u201cmisspoke\u201d famous when talking about her false claim to have landed in Bosnia under sniper fire in 1996. \u201cIf I misspoke,\u201d she said, \u201cthat was just a misstatement.\u201d\nCall it what you like, it\u2019s not uncommon for telesales agents to blatantly lie to potential customers in order to get them to agree to a deal.\u00a0And thanks to call recordings, those lies are demonstrable \u2013 able to be proved.\nSometimes it\u2019s the script that contains the lies; other times the agent goes rogue to close the deal and score the commission.\u00a0And when the lie is exposed by the recording, that usually results in the contract being cancelled, but what\u2019s far more satisfying is the consumer demanding from the company what they\u00a0were falsely promised by that telesales agent \u2013 at no extra cost.That\u2019s exactly what happened to some MultiChoice customers a few years ago.\u00a0\nMultiChoice appointed a company called On Air to cold-call its customers still hanging on to their old decoders, and attempt to \u201chelp them upgrade\u201d with a supposedly special Explora+HD\u00a0decoder combo deal.\u00a0The sales script failed to reveal that DualView and XtraView are worlds apart and that unless they bought two Exploras, they would have vastly reduced functionality on a second set.\nAnd because call recordings proved that the complainants were right about the non-disclosure of the reduced functionality, MultiChoice swapped the HD decoders for Exploras, at no extra\u00a0cost.\u00a0And that created a handy precedent for many others to get a second \u201cfree\u201d Explora.\nCharleen van Eeden of Cape Town\u2019s \u201cgive me what you promised\u201d case was even more delicious.\u00a0Last year she got a call telling her that Vodacom wanted to thank her for her custom with a gift \u2013 not one, but three: a cellphone, tablet and gift voucher from Homemark.Naturally she smelt a rat, so she repeatedly asked about the terms, conditions and costs, and was assured that all she had to do was load R110 worth of data on both \u201cgift\u201d devices.\nAs the call recording later revealed, the salesman had failed to mention that she\u2019d been tied into a 24-month contract.\nBut rather than accepting a simple cancellation of the contract, Van Eeden insisted that Vodacom honour the claim that she was being rewarded for custom with gifts.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why I should return something which I was told \u2013 over and over \u2013 was a gift.\u00a0I was blatantly lied to and my time was wasted, so I feel they must honour what they promised me.\u201d\nI agreed with her and put that to Vodacom, which to its credit felt the same.\u00a0The contract was cancelled, an investigation into the extent of that telesales agent\u2019s lying was launched, and Van Eerden got to keep her three gifts.That case came to mind when I received Elaine Samson\u2019s complaint recently.\u00a0She was told by an telesales agent with SellDirect, one of Telkom\u2019s marketing agents, that a two-year contract came with a Samsung tablet \u201croughly the size of an A4 page\u201d.\nShe agreed to it, but what she got was a tablet half that size \u2013 she could tell by the size of the box. And when she tried to return the unused tablet, still in its sealed box, \u00a0and cancel the deal,\u00a0she was initially told that she couldn\u2019t because the tablet had been \u201cactivated\u201d.\nEventually she managed to get the contract cancelled, but not without a fight.\nI had been very keen to take up her case and argue that she had the right to swap the Samsung tablet she got for an A4-sized one at no extra cost, but Samson wanted no\u00a0more to do with the company by then.So I\u00a0asked Telkom: \u201cHad Ms Samson insisted on swapping the smaller tablet for the one she was promised in that sales call, how would Telkom have responded?\u201d\nNo response. I did get this: \u201cSelldirect Marketing acknowledges that a misrepresentation in relation to the size of the device was made which accelerated the dispute.\n\u201cTelkom apologises to our customer for the frustration and inconvenience caused and we have addressed our dealer on the matter as well to ensure that this does not occur again.\u201d Telesales calls are a super annoying invasion of privacy for most, but there are two very good advantages to agreeing to a deal over the phone:\u00a0\n\nThe call recording is a record of exactly what was said by both parties in the event of a dispute. You\u2019re entitled to access to the call, so don\u2019t take no for an answer.\nYou have a five-business day cooling off period in which to cancel for a full refund, for no particular reason \u2013 you simply get to change your mind, provided you do so in writing.\n\nCONTACT WENDY\nE-mail: consumer@knowler.co.za\nTwitter: @wendyknowler\nFacebook: wendyknowlerconsumer",

  "plain_text": "News that a shiny, straight-out-of-the box political formation built around Jacob Zuma is on the cards is actually old hat. Those of us who have watched Zuma's actions over the past few years and months have always known that, as the light of his kleptocratic state dimmed, he would forge a new populist path to defend himself and his cronies from going to jail. The script is unfolding like clockwork.\nLast week, Zuma supporters gathered at the symbol of the man's grand and comedic corruption \u2013 the grotesque Nkandla and its famed fire pool \u2013 to \u201cwelcome him back\u201d to KwaZulu-Natal. It was nothing of the sort. They were launching part of their fight-back campaign, as I pointed out here months ago.\nWhat is really of interest now is this: What is their thinking? What holds them together? What are their motives?\nIn KwaZulu-Natal last week a member of the ANC national executive committee turned around to me and said: \u201cYou have to ask yourself, why do white people like Cyril Ramaphosa so much?\u201dAt the heart of the new Zuma political movement is this question and their answer to it: that Ramaphosa is a sellout, that he is a stooge of so-called white monopoly capital, that his fight against corruption (at least for now) is really a fight against black advancement.\nThis is the sort of conspiratorial and nonsensical thinking that was invented and disseminated by the defunct British disinformation machinery of Bell Pottinger as paid for by the Gupta family and Zuma's son Duduzane. On Twitter, sitting on his cash pile in Dubai, these are messages that are still disseminated by the president's son as part of his escape from facing the law in South Africa.\nThis grouping gained some faux intellectual input from the likes of the discredited, violent and fascist Andile Mngxitama and his Gupta-sponsored Black First Land First cohort of about 20 strident individuals. When Zuma was fired by the ANC in February, it was the BLF that rushed to loudly proclaim its support for him. They swiftly followed up with a forum where Zuma, who in his tenure as president of the republic oversaw the relentless reversal of the land reform and restitution programme of the ANC, held forth about land restitution.\nWhat they are doing is plain: They appropriate legitimate black struggles (from land hunger to transformation to restitution to justice) and use them for their own selfish and criminal ends.\nSo, then, what we are seeing is a criminal gang disguising itself as a political formation. Think of what ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule, a key player within this faction, said on January 28 in KwaZulu-Natal to supporters: \u201cStay focused, it is just a matter of five years ... Mayibuya i-ANC esiyaziyo (until the ANC that we know returns). It\u2019s a matter of five years comrades. So let\u2019s work hard.\u201dHe was saying he wants a return to the ANC of the Guptas, the ANC of the rigged tenders in North West, the ANC of building palaces for leaders, the ANC of Des van Rooyen and Faith Muthambi and Mosebenzi Zwane, the ANC of unemployment and corruption and poor economic growth. Incredible.\nHow would this political formation do electorally? Two organisations were born out of the ANC in the past 10 years. COPE attracted 7% of the vote in 2009 and proceeded to sink due to infighting. The EFF got 6.3% in 2014 but has not succumbed to major bloodletting among its leaders. Polls show a bigger haul for the EFF in 2019.\nThe new Zuma crowd faces a problem that the pre-Nasrec ANC faced. You can try to dress up your selfish interests as much as you like, but the truth will out. Zuma's party \u2013 or one associated with him \u2013 will fail dismally.\u00a0\u00a0His only chance at a showing of some sort would be to harness the Zulu king into some sort of alliance around the Ingonyama Trust issue. But that would paint him into a corner: He would basically be a tribal leader of the nature of the bantustans, a Mangosuthu Buthelezi with an extremely poor cause.\nThe new Zuma party will huff and puff for a short while, and will die soon enough. As it should.",

  "plain_text": "Let me begin with a disclaimer. An opinion piece is like a pregnancy: you might have planned it, or maybe conception happened while you lay in your bed on the edge of sleep. Both those things happen. And many others too.\nAlso, you just don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to turn out. I\u2019ll avoid giving any spoilers, in the same way one \u201cavoids\u201d cracked nipples or giving birth to a child with colic. Sometimes your baby is Mother Teresa and the devil incarnate in the space of three minutes. It is a changeable and nuanced and complicated experience \u2013 not easily \u201crepresented\u201d in a single piece of art, cinema or song.\nAnd that is the point of this column.\nI recently went to see Tully, a deeply affecting film starring Charlize Theron which, apart from being an exquisitely acted and compelling film, explores the highly prevalent issue of postpartum depression. Or was it about postpartum exhaustion? Or maybe even psychosis? It depends who you ask (or if the thought police are lurking around the corner flat-packing your perceptions and then arresting you for \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d).\nPlaying mainly to rave reviews (87% positive reviews by critics on Rotten Tomatoes and 74% for the audience score), the film was also highly criticised in some quarters for its \u201crepresentation\u201d of postpartum mental health. For example, on Motherly (an online lifestyle publication about motherhood), a midwife has written a piece in which she says: \u201cAs with all mental illness, it\u2019s essential that we do not make any blanket statements\u201d about women who are suffering mentally after giving birth.\nI don\u2019t see how writer Diablo Cody made a \u201cblanket statement\u201d. As far as I understand, she made a movie.\nIn the New York Times, the president of Postpartum Support International said her organisation had been \u201cfielding complaints about the film\u201d, as the \u201cmommy world\u201d was up in arms about the portrayal of perinatal mood disorders and that she could understand why.\nIn my opinion, this anger is counterproductive. The only reason people are reacting so badly to the \u201crepresentations\u201d and \u201cportrayals\u201d of perinatal mental health in this movie is because it is a topic so woefully neglected in cinema \u2013 and in conversation in real life.Just because it\u2019s one of the only films that \u201cgoes there\u201d, is it incumbent upon that film to be the definitive take on the topic? Because Cody is exploring uncharted territory, it doesn\u2019t mean her main character Marlo\u2019s mental makeup carries the weight of that territory in her role.\nImagine if Love Actually was criticised for its portrayal of love. That would be laughable and absurd, simply because there are thousands of movies about love and this is just one of them.\nThe other interesting thing is that all those criticising the movie\u2019s particular construction of postpartum mental ill-health are also lauding it for at least showing the realities of early motherhood: an experience characterised largely by a lack of sleep, a change in identity, dirty nappies, an absent sex life and, often, a body with new contours.\nIt\u2019s tough, and some women fall apart and some cope and some have good-hair days interspersed with crawl-to-the-bottom-of-the-bed days. According to psychologist Monica Starkman, writing for Psychology Today, the baby blues are normal and \u201coccur in up to 75% of women during the first or so week after delivery\u201d.\nThen there is major depressive disorder brought on by pregnancy and, although the incidence is hard to measure because of how the symptoms overlap with normal post-delivery symptoms, it is far less common than the baby blues and is thought to occur \u201cin one in 10\u201d among new moms. Starkman says it can \u201clast for months or years\u201d without treatment (psychotherapy and/or medication).\nFinally, there is postpartum psychosis, which only occurs in \u201cone or two women in 1,000 births\u201d. Starkman says it manifests as \u201cprofound confusion and mental clouding\u201d, as well as hallucinations, and concentration or memory problems.\nThose are useful distinctions, and as a society we should talk about them more, but Marlo is not a page in a textbook. Neither is she the ultimate embodiment of postpartum depression or the patron saint of weird coping mechanisms.\nShe is a character in a movie that dares to explore in real terms how pregnancy and birth can make you feel even when it\u2019s ugly and feels insurmountable. So, instead of whipping the film for what it does or doesn\u2019t say, let\u2019s rather celebrate the fact that it is saying anything on the topic at all, and maybe then the entire topic won\u2019t be such a taboo.",

  "plain_text": "I went to a traditionally white boys\u2019 high school, which is to say, a rugby school. I liked rugby before I went to high school and I like rugby now, but that school did everything it could to make me hate rugby while I was there.\nWhen you arrived in Standard 6\u00a0 you had to memorise the names of the first team and be able to recite them on demand from any passing prefect, who was himself almost invariably one of the names. I made a point of being able to remember 14 of them and forgetting the name of whoever who was asking me. When they became enraged and yelled their own name at me, I would shake my head seriously and say: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so, that doesn\u2019t ring a bell.\u201d\u00a0\nThere were regular compulsories, when you had to go to school on a Saturday afternoon and sing war cries while you watched your first team play some other first team. There were compulsory war-cry practices during big break when juniors had to gather in the school hall under the eye of the head boy to learn how to sing songs that began with lyrics like \u201cWiddly widdly woddly wo\u201d.\nOnce the head boy \u2013 I forget his name now \u2013 spotted me not singing and made me stand up and sing a war cry all on my own. I stood, but I would not sing.\n\u201cThe whole school\u2019s going to sit here until you sing the song, Bristow-Bovey,\u201d said the head boy, whose name I\u2019ve just remembered but wouldn\u2019t mean anything to you. \u201cNo one\u2019s going anywhere until you sing.\u201d\nThat suited me just fine. If he really wanted to punish me he would have made me stand there refusing to sing while everyone else left and had lunch. Head boys were very poor at psychology.The head boy of the school was of course the captain of the first team. Occasionally it would be the captain of the first cricket team, but that would be the sign that it was a weak rugby team that year and all the male teachers would walk around all year with long faces, feeling sad about their lives.\nI played rugby but not very well, so I accepted that I would be forever outside of the currents of mainstream schoolboy power. But then, when I was in standard eight, an astonishing thing happened. The new head boy of the school was announced, and he wasn\u2019t the rugby captain, no, nor cricket captain either.He was a boy named Alan Bowen, and although he ran cross-country as a kind of wheeze to get around the iron school rule that you had to play a winter sport, he wasn\u2019t a sports guy at all. He was a public speaker, and captain of the debating team. He also played jazz piano in his spare time, and wrote music and house plays. He was charming and articulate and well-read and he seemed to give off a kind of light, a coruscation of wit and sophistication, an electricity of possibility. Once he won a provincial speech competition and the next day at big break he gave the speech in the school hall for anyone who wanted to hear it. The hall was packed with boys \u2013 not just weedy academic sorts like me, but real boys, actual boys, boys who were part of the mainstream of the school \u2013 all falling about with laughter and applauding as though they had just seen someone score a try.\nI later learnt about the political battles that tore the staffroom apart in the build-up to Alan being annointed \u2013 the running street battles and terror attacks between those who wanted a traditional rugby head boy and the brave apostles of change. And Alan was something special \u2013 to this day I\u2019ve never seen his like and whenever I write something or give a speech my keenest wish is that it could be one tenth of what he could have done when he was 16 years old\u00a0\u2013 but his ascension changed things. It made the school itself bigger and stronger, wider and deeper, more healthy and robust. It breathed a kind of life into kids who were interested in things outside of the fortunes of the first team. They \u2013 we \u2013 felt as though suddenly there was more than one path through the woods, that we weren\u2019t just there under sufferance or to make up the numbers at compulsories. We felt there was more air for our lungs, that the sunlight could reach us too. It changed some of our lives.\nAlan wasn\u2019t just representing us \u2013 he was representing himself, and the whole school, and the possibility of a new and bigger and better way for that school, and if that\u2019s how it felt in so small an arena as a monocultural, monolingual, old South African whites-only high school in Durban, I can only tremble with joy to imagine what it will mean for so many people, young and old, when Siya Kolisi runs out with the captain\u2019s armband to lead the Springboks.",

He was a public speaker, and captain of the debating team. He also played jazz piano in his spare time, and wrote music and house plays. He was charming and articulate and well-read and he seemed to give off a kind of light, a coruscation of wit and sophistication, an electricity of possibility. Once he won a provincial speech competition and the next day at big break he gave the speech in the school hall for anyone who wanted to hear it. The hall was packed with boys \u2013 not just weedy academic sorts like me, but real boys, actual boys, boys who were part of the mainstream of the school \u2013 all falling about with laughter and applauding as though they had just seen someone score a try.\nI later learnt about the political battles that tore the staffroom apart in the build-up to Alan being annointed \u2013 the running street battles and terror attacks between those who wanted a traditional rugby head boy and the brave apostles of change. And Alan was something special \u2013 to this day I\u2019ve never seen his like and whenever I write something or give a speech my keenest wish is that it could be one tenth of what he could have done when he was 16 years old\u00a0\u2013 but his ascension changed things.

  "plain_text": "At the end of 1970, in the middle of the night, the most famous person in the world boarded a plane to Washington DC.\nOnce airborne, he scribbled a letter on American Airlines stationery to the man he intended to visit that day.\n\u201cDear Mr President,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFirst I would like to introduce myself. I am Elvis Presley and admire you and have great respect for your office.\u201d\nIn the now-famous letter, Elvis explained that he was worried about the America he loved: the \u201cdrug culture, the hippie elements \u2026 Black Panthers, etc\u201d were all threats that needed close watching, and he was offering his services as a watcher.\n\u201cI have no concern or motives other than helping the country out,\u201d he wrote. This wasn\u2019t technically true. Elvis was flying to Washington in the hopes of adding one more badge to his impressive collection of law-enforcement trinkets: he wanted to be made a federal agent. Specifically, he wanted a badge from the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, a magical object that would, he believed, allow him to tote his huge collection of guns, along with his personal dispensary of recreational drugs, anywhere he wished, unmolested.\nAt 6.30 that morning. he delivered his letter to the White House, and waited. Richard Nixon\u2019s people thought it would be a good photo opportunity, and so Elvis entered the building for a meeting of suspicious minds.\nAccording to those present, the summit was a satisfying one. Elvis explained that The Beatles were one of the major threats to American morals, and that he had also been looking into Communist brainwashing techniques. Nixon agreed that Elvis should get a narc badge (the singer was so delighted he gave Nixon what was probably only the third or fourth hug of his life), pictures were taken, White House cufflinks were given to Elvis\u2019s entourage, and the meeting came to a close.\nThat bizarre encounter has been one of the strangest images of the American presidency for almost 50 years.\nBut this week it was given a twin.The meeting of Donald Trump and Kim Kardashian is, in many ways, a continuation of the story begun that day in 1970. Both figures in the new photograph are direct descendants of those in the original: Trump is president because Nixon broke America\u2019s belief in the presidency and politics in general; Kardashian is in the Oval Office because enough people believe that fame, however it is generated, is a measure of human worth \u2013 a belief entrenched as dogma by the first high priest of celebrity, Elvis Presley.\nThe differences between the two pictures, however, are telling.\nIn the 1970 picture, Nixon seems amused by Elvis, while the singer plays it cool, trying not to scream at the sheer delight of being surrounded by all that law and order. They are front and centre in the frame, side by side, Butch and Sundance ready to save the world from hippies and Lennonism.\nTrump and Kardashian, however, are literally dwarfed by the office of the president. They look like children trying on adult clothes; like self-conscious hunters posing on the corpse of an elephant.The image is formally composed, a crude attempt at authority and posterity. Trump cannot stand next to Kardashian as Nixon stood next to Elvis because he has to sit behind the desk to prove that he is president. And so she stands to one side, opening up a giant hole on the right side of the picture; a hole that draws the eye and asks the mind to fill it.\nWho should be standing there who isn\u2019t? The still-absent Melania Trump? An actual expert on prison reform, the reason for this meeting? The half of Americans who didn\u2019t vote for Trump precisely because they understood that this image would be inevitable? History, standing invisibly off to one side, laughing at Trump and the society that saw fit to elect him?\nOf course, Trump\u2019s meeting with Kardashian is no sillier than posing with a drug-addled sequined-jumpsuit-wearing pop star who wants to be a narc. But for those who despair at having a hound-dog for a president (he ain\u2019t no friend of theirs), and who long for him to make a jailhouse rock, this would have reminded them that, at least until 2020, they\u2019re caught in a trap and can\u2019t walk out.",

  "plain_text": "There is no shortage of education sceptics these days. Does education really matter? Look at the number of unemployed graduates. After all, the matric certificate is pretty worthless given the low passing standards. Why bother?\nThose questions make sense to cash-strapped parents. Believe it or not, there are elite schools in South Africa whose tuition fees are higher than those of universities. And students now graduate with a huge debt burden, given the spiraling costs of higher education.\nIs private spending on education really worthwhile given these high costs and the possibility that the degreed student might not even get a job?\nWell, my favourite economist for plain speaking, Mike Schussler, recently shared with me a batch of new statistics on the value of education in South Africa. The results will shock you.\nMarketable matric\nIt turns out that the greatest difference in earnings across years of schooling is between those pupils with only a Grade 11 and those with a Grade 12 qualification. In fact, your salary nearly doubles if you have the matric certificate compared with what a Grade 11 will earn.\nIt is strange, but clearly matriculation signals something powerful in the market that brings considerable benefit to the person who successfully completes high school. This is a huge motivation to get more pupils to finish high school, given that slightly more than half of those who started in Grade 2 will eventually drop out of school, especially at or around Grade 10.\nFrom a policy point of view this is a priority: ensure more children complete grade school. The straightforward economic benefits to individuals and, by extension, their families, are not inconsequential.The earnings picture gets even better for those who complete a first (bachelor\u2019s) degree. According to Schussler, your salary increases by a factor of more than 135% compared with a person with matric alone: \u201cAssuming one completes a degree in about three-and-a-half years, each year of tertiary education equates to around six years of schooling in real-life earnings.\u201d\nSo, education is a real return on investment, says my guru economist.\nTaking the long view, the return on that investment is 373% higher than for a person with matriculation alone. And the further you study, the better off you will be in terms of earnings. In fact, a student with a master\u2019s or doctoral degree has a return of 482% on that investment compared with somebody with matric alone.\nThis positive story raises several other questions, such as does the quality of the education matter? Of course it does. What kind of job you find or the level of appointment in a particular job surely depends on how well you passed and which university you attended.\nThose are also important signals in the job market. Even so, it would seem from this data that just finishing school or attaining a first degree still makes a massive difference in earnings, regardless of quality factors.\nThen how does one explain unemployed graduates?\nWell, in a developing country with a slow growth economy after a global recession there will always be graduates without jobs. And there never really is a perfect match between degrees obtained and jobs available. Yet, the fact is that graduate unemployment is only 7.4% whereas for those with matric alone, unemployment stands at 27.9%.Incidentally, a professor friend who teaches political economy is often asked about \u201cthe educated unemployed\u201d in Africa; to which his stock response is: Would you rather have \u201cuneducated unemployed?\u201d\nThere is a final question that parents and students often wonder about: What specific field of study pays best? Well, the top earners are graduates in the mathematics sciences and, in particular, the actuarial sciences. This is bad news for a country where the overwhelming majority of high school pupils choose dummy maths (also known as mathematical literacy) without a chance of entering professions where real maths is required.\nAlso at the top end of the earnings spectrum are psychology, law and, yes, agriculture. Those earning very little by comparison are in the fields of hospitality, tourism and the military sciences, three spots below education and training.\nOn this note, an important warning: you should never choose a career based simply on potential earnings. You also choose what to study because of what is important to you as a human being. For me, being a teacher became the single most important career decision because of the difference I could make in the lives of many, many students and their families.\nNo amount of money could ever give me the satisfaction of knowing that I make a difference in the lives of real people.",

  "plain_text": "It is a strange thing, to exist in the knowledge that, every once in a while, you will receive an acute reminder of the very worst day of your life. Yet that has been my reality for almost five years, and it happened again over the\u00a0 weekend.\nI was on Twitter when I learnt of the tragic deaths of two young people, 18-year-old Georgia Jones and 20-year-old Tommy Cowan, at the Mutiny festival in Portsmouth, UK, on Saturday.\nA familiar helplessness crept over me as I read the story. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what had happened (the police had not yet confirmed the details) but it seemed inevitable that drugs would be involved; that these would turn out to be more entirely avoidable deaths.On Sunday, Georgia Jones\u2019s mother wrote as much on Facebook. \u201cI can now say Georgia died yesterday due to complications after taking two pills at Mutiny,\u201d Janine Milburn said, in a post since shared more than 13,000 times.\n\u201cIf nothing else, I hope what has happened to her will deter you from taking anything ever. The pills had caused her temperature to rise so high it made her fit for 45 minutes.\u201d\nWhenever this happens \u2013 and it happens with heartbreaking regularity \u2013 I immediately think of the families involved. I think of what they\u2019re going through, and what it meant for me when I was that mother.\nIn July 2013, my only child, Martha Fernback, died from an accidental ecstasy overdose when she was just 15 years old. She was taking the drug for the fourth time, with friends on a Saturday morning, and swallowed half a gram. But like so many young people, she had no idea what the pill was composed of. I later found out it was 91% pure MDMA (the chemical name for ecstasy).\nIn one go, she had taken enough for four people.\nAll I knew was 'just say no'\nI can physically recall the shock when I heard my life had been torn apart, that day in 2013. If you have ever had a near-crash in a car, and experienced that momentary whoosh of adrenaline as you\u2019re frozen in horrible, numb helplessness, you will know some of the feeling.Imagine that, but with it staying with you forever.\nAs a single mother, I always lived in fear that I would die and leave Martha as an orphan. You never assume it could be the other way round, so nothing prepares you for just how it might feel.\nAs a parent, you just cross your fingers and hope this kind of thing will never happen to you. I know I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t think we were \u201cthat kind of family\u201d. Now I know there is no such thing as \u201cthat kind of family\u201d.I was always a fair, modern parent, but when it came to the talk about drugs all I knew was the traditional \u201cjust say no\u201d advice. But I also knew, as I think we all do, that teenagers will be teenagers.\nWhen you reach adolescence, you are curious to try things, to rebel and feel a little danger. It is perfectly natural to want to escape life for a moment \u2013 I should know; I have tried hard enough to leave my reality behind over the past few years \u2013 and parties and music festivals are there for that purpose.I didn\u2019t want to stand in the way of Martha having fun, or deny her the chance to learn from her mistakes. And when it came to drugs, I hoped her school might have encouraged her to educate herself about them.\nYet, six weeks before she died, I found out that Martha had taken ecstasy for the first time and I spoke to her about it. I tried to put her off, explaining that pills can be cut with any old chemicals and poisons.\nAfter she died, I found out she had been researching ways to take drugs safely. Sadly, in the age of the Internet black market, the risks are greater than ever, and young people have no way of knowing what they\u2019re putting in their bodies.\nThose of us alive in the 1990s might remember the case of Leah Betts, the Essex schoolgirl who died shortly after her 18th birthday after taking an ecstasy tablet and subsequently drinking seven litres of water in 90 minutes.The images of Leah in a coma\u00a0\u2013 looking just like Martha did in her final hours \u2013 stunned the nation into a moral panic, and brought the risks of recreational party drugs into sharp focus.\nWe were jolted out of our comfort zone; these weren\u2019t substances that were solely a danger for certain members of society you\u2019d read about in things like Irvine Welsh\u2019s Trainspotting (published two years before Leah\u2019s death, incidentally). It could happen to anybody, anywhere.\nBut Leah Betts died in 1995. We were on high alert for a few years, but that was nearly 23 years ago, and the majority of today\u2019s ecstasy users weren\u2019t even alive when her story made the news.\nA matter of priority\nPerhaps we became blas\u00e9 and lost sight of the lessons her case taught us, but it feels like a different world now, for both parents and young people. When I go into schools to speak about drugs today, the teenagers there don\u2019t know Leah Betts, and haven\u2019t seen those photographs of her in intensive care. Why would they?\nThese days, organisations like Anyone\u2019s Child\u00a0\u2013 an international campaign that brings together families who want new legislation that is centred on compassion, health and honesty, rather than criminalisation \u2013 are doing vital work, but everybody needs to be making drug education a priority. That includes parents, teachers, politicians and our teenagers themselves.There are things that parents can do. They can contact their MP and get the subject on the agenda. And if they have teenagers giddily packing their bags to head off to one of the summer\u2019s many other music festivals, then speak to them as openly as you can. A lot of parents will have dabbled in drugs themselves in the past, but it is not hypocritical to remember for a moment what you were like at that age. If your parents said don\u2019t do it, you probably went and did it.\nSo be straight with them. You can tell them to look at the advice on The Loop\u2019s website and you can tell them that at the first sign of distress in their friends, they must get help and they won\u2019t be in trouble for it.\nIt might be a difficult conversation to have, but the advice could save a life. For all I know, it might have saved Martha\u2019s.\nIn October, my beautiful daughter would have turned 21, and in a few weeks it will have been half a decade since I lost her. But bereavement doesn\u2019t wear a watch. To me it still feels like it happened yesterday, or sometimes it feels as if it hasn\u2019t happened at all. I wake up and assume my Martha is here in her bedroom, as she always was, before I realise again what happened.Just as Georgia Jones\u2019s mother says her \u201clittle girl was 18 and full of life\u201d, so was Martha. That phrase we often hear applied to victims of tragedies like this \u2013 \u201cfull of life\u201d \u2013 is perfectly appropriate, because there is so much potential in young people. To think of just how avoidable these drugs deaths are makes the theft of that potential all the more painful.\nI don\u2019t want anybody to ever know how it feels to lose a child like this, and almost five years on from my own experience, I cannot quite believe that I am still writing about it.\nThis weekend, though, as two more families have their lives changed forever, it proves why this conversation is one that we need now more than ever. But I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019re pointing in the right direction. The government is starting to listen, parents and teenagers are becoming more aware, and our campaign work is having an effect.\nStill, the process is slow, and accidental overdoses continue. I am tired of telling my story, but if we can save even one more young person from needlessly losing their life, the heartache will have been worth it.\n\u2022 As told to Guy Kelly.",

  "plain_text": "On Monday, local media reported that the Guptas would be getting their Estina dairy cash back after they won their court case against the National Prosecuting Authority. This seemed like a strange thing to claim, given that the Guptas will be getting our Estina diary cash back, but then what do I know about the law?\nThe verdict triggered a self-righteous roar from Captured Twitter, where Zumistas poured onto the digital streets to proclaim that a \u201creal court\u201d had dealt a blow to White Monopoly Capital and that our justice system was magnificent, except, obviously, when it ruled against Jacob Zuma or the Guptas and was clearly the plaything of George Soros.\nBut beyond the hilarious hypocrisy of Zuma\u2019s fart-catchers, the verdict was a useful reminder of the current state of play.\nI\u2019ve always been dazzled by the chutzpah of the people who've looted this country.The British, at least, had the good grace to go back to Britain and not talk about where Great-Grandpappa got the very large diamond he gave Great-Grandmamma.\nThe apartheid goons have been far bolder, protesting from the log-bar in their wine estate that it\u2019s not looting if white people do it and, anyway, they worked super-hard for those billions, attending at least five Armscor AGMs and going to Magnus Malan\u2019s annual Day of the Vow party even if it was raining.\nTo defend your loot in court, however, takes some special chops.\nI don't know about you, but if I\u2019d been implicated in a decade-long conspiracy to dismantle a country\u2019s democratic institutions and steal from its poor, I would probably say: \"Actually, you know what? You hang onto the cars and the helicopters, and I'll just be on my way with these couple of billions.\"\nBut of course it\u2019s not just stunning entitlement. It's business. And that\u2019s what we need to remember about all of the Capturati as they continue to fight for every cent for the next many years.\nTo them, the attempted destruction of South Africa wasn't a crime. It was a transaction. They invested, and now they need to see a return. Issues of shame or dignity don\u2019t apply. After all, when you try to sell a house and the deal goes south, you don\u2019t feel ashamed about arguing in front of the ants that live in the walls. So why would the Capturati feel any shame about arguing in front of us?\nNo, the people who tried to sell South Africa want to get paid. They will not walk away.",

  "plain_text": "For certain black players in most sporting codes, it appears that even when you\u2019re winning, you\u2019re still losing.\nThe past 12 months have quite possibly been the greatest in English footballer Raheem Sterling\u2019s career. He was nominated for the Professional Footballers Association Player of the Year\u00a0 alongside Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane, Manchester United\u2019s Marcus Rashford, Fulham\u2019s Ryan Sessegnon and his two Manchester City teammates Leroy Sane (the eventual winner) and Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson. Manchester City had already tied up another English Premier League title\u00a0\u2013 with Sterling contributing 18 goals and 11 assists in his 33 league matches. It came as no surprise that he was included in Gareth Southgate\u2019s 23-man England squad for the Fifa World Cup beginning in a few weeks. It was truly deserved for a player who, had he let his circumstances deter him, could have crumbled and wasted his undoubted talent.\nLast year, a buffoon named Karl Anderson was jailed for an unprovoked racist attack on Sterling, telling him he hoped that his \u201cmother and child wake up dead in the morning you n**ger\u201d. He went on to repeatedly kick the City player, leaving him bruised.Sterling was born in an unglamorous side of Kingston, Jamaica\u00a0\u2013 where his father was shot dead when he was two years old. His mother moved him and his sister to an estate in London. He would later attend a special school because of \u201cbehaviour problems\u201d. It has been reported that a teacher once told him, when he was 10 years old, that \u201cif you carry on the way you\u2019re going, by the time you\u2019re 17 you\u2019ll either be playing for England or you\u2019ll be in prison\u201d. There were other instances, where he was criticised for fathering two children from different relationships.\nCertainly, for a reputedly snarky and often partisan tabloid culture in the UK, Sterling has given them ammunition\u00a0\u2013 the latest being a gun tattoo on his right foot, which he later explained was actually a tribute to his late father. In his Instagram post, he wrote: \u201cI made a promise to myself i would never touch a gun in my life time, I shoot with my right foot so it has a deeper meaning. N still unfinished [sic]\u201d. But Tuesday\u2019s edition of The Sun newspaper\u2019s backpage screamed: \u201cRaheem shoots himself in foot\u201d\u00a0\u2013 quoting anti-gun activists, who called for his expulsion from the England team. In particular, The Sun has been diligent in its attempts to tarnish his talent\u00a0\u2013 referring to him as \u201cfootie idiot Raheem Sterling\u201d and calling him \u201cgreedy\u201d after his big-money move from Liverpool to Manchester City. They also pinned England\u2019s Euro 2016 failures on him, quickly calling him an \u201cEngland failure\u201d and \u201cobscene\u201d for buying his mother a home.The Guardian\u2019s columnist Barney Ronay\u2019s 2017 op-ed, \u201cHow Raheem Sterling was made into an easy target for gathered intangible rage\u201d touched on how \u201cfootball thrives on easy targets, on muster points for all that gathered intangible rage\u201d, and how the accusations of players lacking toughness or balls had often \u201cbeen said in the past about black footballers in England. It was said, quite a lot, about Sterling.\u201dThank heavens he never let the relentless daggers thrown in his direction pierce his brain, for he seems to have some great mental fortitude. Strength of mind is a prerequisite for any sportsman, but particularly when black and navigating predominantly white spaces, where it appears you\u2019re expected to show gratitude for being \u201callowed in\u201d. It also seems to me that like newly-elected Springbok captain Siya Kolisi, like SuperSport rugby pundit Ashwin Willemse, and so many others (including former Chelsea youth-team players Gwyn Williams and Graham Rix, who claimed to have been subjected to racial abuse during their time at the club) to survive you must also get to a realisation that you may never be able to shift negative perceptions of you, regardless of your excellence. There is always some way to distract from your talents.\nTop flanker Kolisi has had to deal with this attitude from the get-go. His 28 Bok caps and over 100 Super Rugby appearances for the Stormers don\u2019t matter as much as the fact that he married a white woman (racist trolls referred to Rachel Kolisi as a \u201cwaste of good white genes\u201d when the pair married), nor does it seem to matter that he has shown great leadership skills for quite some time now. But Bok coach Rassie Erasmus had to calm frayed nerves of racists by assuring them this week that Kolisi\u2019s ascension to the captaincy wasn\u2019t a decision to satisfy quota protocols.\u201cI know Siya is a good leader and I am excited about what he can offer us,\u201d offered Erasmus. \u201cI coached him since he was 18 years old when he arrived at the Stormers from the Eastern Cape and through the academy until he played for the Stormers. I know him as a good rugby player \u2026 The players we have in this squad deserve to be here and I am not trying to fabricate things.\u201d\nSports might thrive on easy targets, and in the case of black sportsmen, it almost always appears to be more at play than just their on-field performances.",
