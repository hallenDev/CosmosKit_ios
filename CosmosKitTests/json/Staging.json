I followed her as she went to ANC offices in her home province of Mpumalanga and to the legislator and briefed my principal on her daily movements, including politicians that she met,\u201d part of the e-mail reads.\nHe goes on to say that on one occasion he followed her to a regional office of the Democratic Alliance to obtain anything that he could to incriminate her.\n\u201cThis is another unlawful dirty acts [sic] including laying criminal charges against her in order to prevent her from laying any charges or wrong doing against my principal, were done using the said State Owned motor vehicle,\u201d said the whistleblower in his responses.\nHe also detailed how he had driven to the Free State to \u201cillegally\u201d collect information about the general manager of communication, Noluvuyo Halana, who was said to be close to Xulu.",

                                    "plain_text": "Anil Agarwal, the Indian billionaire with a penchant for South African wines, was never going to be a passive Anglo investor. For one, there's no economic benefit to his investment as his 20% stake was bought using convertible bonds, which only mature in three years. It is only at that point that he'll be able to take ownership of those shares either by settling in cash or choosing to use those shares to repay the bonds. This was always a strategic play, a chess move that seemed a vote against Mark Cutifani's strategy of shrinking the one-time giant to focusing on three minerals.\nGiven that Agarwal's plan to merge his resources empire with Anglo was rejected last year, clearly his thoughts around the Oppenheimer-founded miner wasn't about slimming it down. What the market has been waiting for since his emergence as Anglo's biggest shareholder has been his thoughts on the company, whose shares have rallied 167% over the past two years. Speaking to the Financial Times on Friday, the market got its first sense of his views on its long-term future, and they don't involve a break-up. Instead, he feels the miner should invest \"more money\" into its South African operations. This is sure to spook international investors that have long been concerned by the country's volatile political climate. Tomorrow's share moves may prove to be interesting.\nAgarwal told the paper that the miner should rather \"cherish\" its local assets, which include Anglo American Platinum and Kumba Iron Ore. \"I like the structure as it is at this point in time,\" he said.\nThe Public Investment Corporation, now the second-biggest shareholder in Anglo with more than a 14% stake, shares a similar view. Their combined stake surely now puts paid to any further asset sales that Anglo's executive may have on the table. After the recovery of commodity prices over the past year - not so much a recovery but a stabilisation to a slightly upward tick - Anglo has said the asset sales are not as urgent a matter, though it has recommitted itself to such plans.\nIt seems Agarwal and the PIC have a strategic alliance - planned or not - and one that puts paid to not only the board's current plans but also analyst calls for the mining juggernaut to be split into two companies: one focused on South Africa and the other on its international assets.\nWith political uncertainty at its peak, confidence levels plummeting to depths last seen in the '80s and growth levels where they are at the moment, Agarwal's statements are quite a positive development. A vote of confidence where none seems to exist.\nIt's understandable that South African corporations that now have a shareholder registry full of international investors are being pushed to look outside not only this country's borders but those of the continent itself. That whole \"Africa Rising\" narratiive has long lost favour with international markets.\nPolitics in South Africa do make for some rather difficult reading at the moment, with shots being fired as contestation heats up in these times of economic fragility.\nAnglo, much like the rand, is something of a share price representing the South African story. Its shift away from it, with the country only representing 7% of its revenue but 76% of its employees, has helped cement the idea that putting capital into this ground has become too risky. Retailers and property stocks have all followed suit, predominantly choosing the developed markets of Europe as an escape from South African risk. Their excursions have seemed rather rushed and, given the report cards - such as Brait's which this week had to value its UK investment in New Look at zero - an expensive exercise.\nCorporates that aggressively seek to diversify their businesses outside South Africa may be better rewarded by the stock markets, but is this not the problem with short-termism?

That includes buildings both old and spanking new, road names, shops, inhabitants, even the landscape (if the weird buff-yellow hills formed by mine dumps count as such).\nEating places are no different. When something hangs around for more than a decade, it's cause for celebration. I hadn't visited the Italian restaurant Vera Vita on Rifle Range Road, south of the city centre, for quite some time. Years and years in fact, and I can't think why not. Reminded of it by friends who are staunch regulars, we hit the M1 south for Sunday lunch.Few chefs in the city maintain the quality that Angelo Capporino does. He's even more covered with tattoos than I remember. They seem to have magical powers; increasing his cooking skills as they cover his skin. Passion is such a revoltingly over-used and misused word when it comes to food and chefs but, well, here the word is right.\nOf the dishes we inhaled, it was hard to decide what was best. The melanzane is a take on the traditional dish. Instead of the usual layers of eggplant, cheese and tomato, Capporino makes tiny tomato-filled eggplant wraps, covered with melted cheese. They're weirdly light for something so cheesy.\nI think, though, that the porcini and Parma pasta was the winner. Perfectly cooked rigatoni-like shapes with crisp-fried Parma, and the merest suggestion of mushrooms, herbs, cream and Parmesan. The dish was a lesson in restraint while being deeply intense in flavour. No Parmesan or black pepper offered, because none was necessary (why do so many restaurants keep offering black pepper over almost everything as though it's a neutral element?)The menu contains both classics and twists. Angelo has enough talent, and a light enough hand, that he manages to get away with some very odd combinations. We ate a pizza - thin, flaky and light - topped with Emmenthaler cheese and loved it. Sadly, there was no space to fit in the minestrone, which I remember as having pretty much saved my life one flu-riddled day years ago.\nIf this place was just a little closer to me, it would be my local. It's comfortingly old fashioned, and the presence of many Italian diners is even more comforting.\nDon't expect old-school to be your impression though. A major revamp is coming up shortly, with the space getting more compact and the semi-separated rooms becoming a centralised space with more vibe. I'm not panicking: they promise they're only changing the space; the food is staying the same.\nFind Vera Vita at 255 Rifle Range Road, Haddon/Oakdene, Joburg. Call 011-434-1019.",

They seem to have magical powers; increasing his cooking skills as they cover his skin. Passion is such a revoltingly over-used and misused word when it comes to food and chefs but, well, here the word is right.\nOf the dishes we inhaled, it was hard to decide what was best. The melanzane is a take on the traditional dish. Instead of the usual layers of eggplant, cheese and tomato, Capporino makes tiny tomato-filled eggplant wraps, covered with melted cheese. They're weirdly light for something so cheesy.\nI think, though, that the porcini and Parma pasta was the winner. Perfectly cooked rigatoni-like shapes with crisp-fried Parma, and the merest suggestion of mushrooms, herbs, cream and Parmesan.

What style means to the homeowners and designers who shape these interiors goes beyond the study of a period or popular aesthetic. It\u2019s down to a meeting of influences, often enmeshing considerable history with modernity and progressive tastes that can only be described as unconventional. \u201cThe days of genteel restraint are finally past, and we are free to push the limits out again,\u201d writes editor Sally Fuls of the homes that share a freedom of style. Below, a small taste of what to expect.\nA Breeze From the Past, Italy\nFor the renovation of this Milanese apartment design duo Andreas Marcante and Adelaide Testa of Marcante-Testa turned the focus of the space inward. Turning its back on the city to overlook a lush private garden, attention was placed on channelling nature, while nodding to familiar notions of domesticity. With leafy wallpaper mirroring the foliage seen through elegant casement windows, a host of natural textures like linen, parquet and cane webbing, as well as a palette of blues and greens that reference the natural world, the space has been infused with a sense of tranquillity second to none.RMGB, Paris\nFusing minimalism with high design, Paris design duo Guillaume Gibert and Baptiste Rischmann of French studio RMGB create synergy in the spaces they design with a fusion of contrary elements. Often distinguishable for their understated, monochromatic backdrops, they play off calm with colour and pattern. In the renovation of an old Toulouse townhouse, the designers once again exercise their love of juxtaposition. Stainless steel kitchen tops, resin floors and large spans of glazing meet herringbone parquetry and fine mouldings; while meticulous craftsmanship (a calling card of the duo) finds company with notable contemporary and mid-century design pieces.Nicoise Idiosyncrasy, France\nDespite its 19th century origins and all the marks of classic architecture such as floor to ceiling casement windows, ancient terracotta floor tiles and original friezes, this Nicoise apartment spells fun. Loosely arranged geometric and organic shapes abound by way of cushions and hanging sculptures, whose purpose is to delight the senses. Home of furniture designer Stephanie Marin, it\u2019s playful and relaxed with lashings of colour across the pastel spectrum. Wood and cork shelving units, sofas and desks all nod to her occupation and communicate an informality in contrast with the building\u2019s history.A Fashionable Interior, New York\nNew York based Mona Kowalski has created an idiosyncratic interior that\u2019s as free spirited and bohemian as she is. As the owner of women\u2019s slow fashion brand A D\u00e9tacher she is deeply rooted in the world of style but approaches it with meaning and thought. Something of a treasury, her Brooklyn brownstone is filled with personal and nostalgic keepsakes gathered over time. From books to linen, what she holds dear, she artfully displays on the available surfaces of her apartment in piles and tableaus.The Art of Illusion, Germany\nSpacial constraints were the guiding force behind the redesign of this bright, turn of the century apartment belonging to a priest and his fashion designer wife in Mainz, Germany. Clever use of colour and flooring to delineate separate living areas, as well as select small pieces of furniture have given the space a perceived sense of openness. Tricking the eye and the mind, Studio Oink\u2019s Lea Korzecsek and Matthias Hiller have set their own brand of minimalism to work with the careful inclusion of antiques, portrait paintings, wood tones, velvet and brass accents to bring warmth and a dose of luxury.",

I eavesdrop on a tour guide who explains to weary complaining American tourists that the man in the frame was the actual old man who had a tumultuous time fishing for marlins in Ernest Hemingway\u2019s sea.His name was Gregorio Fuentes and he was Hemingway\u2019s boat keeper and the hotel where his portrait resides was the residence of his friend and master from 1928 to the 1940s.The one tourist from the group - in amongst her complaints about the amount of walking there was in the walking tour - remarks that she is glad to have seen this place as she really loves Hemingway. I stand there sipping my fourth mojito of the day, staring at the self same wall, for the opposite reason: I hate Ernest Hemingway.\nHate may be a strong word but at least it is to the point, which I am sure quick-witted Hemingway would have appreciated. It is his concise prose that elevates him to the echelons of literary godhood in most circles, whereas it is his utter disrespect and awful treatment of his second wife, Martha Gelhorn, my personal journalistic hero, which explains my disdain. But try as I might to avoid him, his smug bearded face was around every corner in downtown Havana, so dealing with these feelings were inevitable.\nI had originally envisioned my travels to Cuba to be a rum-soaked delight wherein I would savour every variation of the sugary dark liquor \u2013 el ron to the locals - that I could get my hands on. So imagine my surprise when I discovered that, thanks to the communist state of the island, the only delight to be had was at the government-owned Havana Club and, if I was lucky, in the form of a questionable looking label called Legendario. That, coupled with the lack of internet (ie none at all) made me realise I would have to find alternative means to entertain myself.\nSo I decided to bar hop my way through the favourite mojito drinking holes of the man who would boast that he could \"drink hells any amount of whiskey without getting drunk.\"\nFirst stop was La Bodeguita Del Medio, a light blue bar in an alley near Havana\u2019s Plaza de la Catedral. A pixilated, photocopied sign purportedly by the man himself claims that this is where his favourite minty syrup cocktail was made. According to the locals, no one is really sure if this claim is authentic or not, but it doesn\u2019t really matter to those carrying the guide books. And the barman knows his clientele well enough to have a row of mojitos at the ready at any given moment.The drink is better than expected for a tourist spot, with the perfect balance of lime to sugar and a generous kick of rum. The bar itself is well worn and forgiving to sit at, the walls are covered in paintings and declarations by other Cuban artists and writers. All this coupled with the live Cuban salsa jazz band shaking maracas in the corner creates an ambiance convincing enough that I can see why Hemingway would perhaps have spent his nights here. Fine, well played, Papa, you win round one.Next stop, I\u2019m at Hotel Ambos Mundos, sipping a spectacularly average mojito, staring at the photo of Gregario. I once again eavesdrop on the tour guide as she explains how Hemingway\u2019s Nobel Prize medal was stolen in 1986, only to be later returned after threats from Raul Castro. You know you\u2019re well loved in a country when even the then Minister of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces has your back.\nThe self same guy is now serving his last term as president and also has a handle on pretty much the only rum in town. Which is how I find myself at the Havana Club Bar because like everything in communism: if you can\u2019t beat them, join them.\nHere you will find white linen shirt-wearing old men singing all the songs made famous in Jon Favreau\u2019s movie, Chef, along with pretty excellent mojitos and daiquiris.\nConveniently situated next door is the rum museum where they press fresh sugar syrup for your drinks and have a tiny diorama depicting slaves working the fields to harvest and processing the sugar for the rum in said drinks.\nAs the tiny model train moves the fake tiny slave sugar around you learn that under state rule, the government makes sure that Havana Club gets the best molasses in the state and that everyone else gets the second grade leftovers. It would appear that even the sugar on the island, like Hemingway all those years ago, does well having friends in high places.CUBA COMES TO JOBURG\nIf you would like taste a tiny slice of the Caribbean closer to home, I suggest that when the bell tolls you find your way down to Brian Lara in Linden, Johannesburg and enjoy the 80 rums they did not have to offer in Havana. Start with the new SPYTAIL Black Ginger\u00a0Rum.",

You know you\u2019re well loved in a country when even the then Minister of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces has your back.\nThe self same guy is now serving his last term as president and also has a handle on pretty much the only rum in town. Which is how I find myself at the Havana Club Bar because like everything in communism: if you can\u2019t beat them, join them.\nHere you will find white linen shirt-wearing old men singing all the songs made famous in Jon Favreau\u2019s movie, Chef, along with pretty excellent mojitos and daiquiris.\nConveniently situated next door is the rum museum where they press fresh sugar syrup for your drinks and have a tiny diorama depicting slaves working the fields to harvest and processing the sugar for the rum in said drinks.\nAs the tiny model train moves the fake tiny slave sugar around you learn that under state rule, the government makes sure that Havana Club gets the best molasses in the state and that everyone else gets the second grade leftovers. It would appear that even the sugar on the island, like Hemingway all those years ago, does well having friends in high places.",
